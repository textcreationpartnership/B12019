            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Since when, at the intreatie of others my friends, I was content to let it come to light, conditionally, that some one or other, would peruse and amend the errours escaped;
<pb facs="tcp:173111:4"/> my many affaires hindering mee from vndergoing that labour. Now I vnderstand by the Printer, that the Copie was presented to your Honour: which did at the first somewhat disgust mee, because as it must passe, I feare much, it will proue farre vnworthy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Noble view or protection. Yet since it is mine, though abortiue, I doe humbly intreate, that your Honour will lend it a fauourable countenance, there by to animate the parent thereof to produce in time some worthier subiect, in your Honourable name, whose many rare vertues haue already rendred me so highly deuoted to your seruice, as I will some day giue very euident tokens of the same, and till then I rest,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOV maist beleeue mee (gentle Reader) without swearing, that I could willingly desire this booke (as a child of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) to be the most beautifull, gallant, and discreet, that might possibly bee imagined. But I could not transgresse the order of Nature, wherein euery thing begets his like: which being so, what could my sterile and il-tild wit ingender, but the history of a dry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, &amp; humorous son, full of various thoughts &amp; conceits neuer before imagined of any other: much like one who was ingendred within some noysome prison, where all discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiries haue taken possession, and all dolefull noyses made their habitation? seeing that rest, pleasant places, ameni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fieldes, the cheerefulnesse of cleere skie, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring noyse of the Cristall fountaines, and the quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the spirit are great helpes for the most barren Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to shew themselues fruitful, and to bring forth into the world such births as may enrich it with admiration and delight. It oft times befals, that a father hath a child both by birth euil-fauoured and quite deuoide of all perfection, and yet the loue that hee beares him is such, as it casts a maske ouer his eies which hinders his discerning of the
<pb facs="tcp:173111:5"/> faults and simplicities thereof, and makes him rather to deeme them discretions and beauty, and so tels them to his friends, for witty iests and conceites. But I (though in shew a Father yet in truth but a stepfather to <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> will not be born away by the violent current of the modern custome now a daies, and therefore intreate thee, with the teares almost in mine eies as many others are wont to doe, (most deare Reader) to pardon and dissemble the faults which thou shalt discerne in this my sonne: for thou art neither his kinsman nor friend, and thou hast thy soule in thy body, and thy free wil therein as absolute as the best, and thou art in thine owne house wherein thou art as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute a Lord, as the King is of his subsidies and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est well the common Prouerbe, that <hi>vnder my cloake a fig for the King,</hi> all which doth exempt thee and makes thee free from all respect and obligation; and so thou maist boldely say of this history whatsoeuer thou shalt think good without feare eyther to be controlled for the euil, or rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the good that thou shalt speake thereof.</p>
            <p>I would very faine haue presented it vnto thee pure &amp; naked, without the ornament of a Preface, or the rabble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Catalogue of the wonted Sonnets, Epigrams Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems Elegies &amp;c, which are wont to bee put at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of bookes. For I dare say vnto thee that (although it cost me some paines to compose it) yet in no respect did it equalize that which I tooke to make this preface which thou dost now reade. I tooke oftentimes my pen in my hand to write it, and as often set it downe again, as not knowing what I should write, and being once in a muse with my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before me, my pen in mine eare, mine elbow on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my hand on my cheeke, imagining what I might
<pb facs="tcp:173111:5"/> write, there entred, a friend of mine vnexpectedly who was a very discret &amp; pleasantly witted man: who seeing me so pensatiue, demanded of me the reason of my musing: and not concealing it from him, said, that I bethought my selfe on my preface I was to make to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> history, which did so much trouble me, as I neither meane to make any at all, nor publishe the history of the acts of so noble a knight. For how can I chuse (quoth I) but bee much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at that which the old legislator (the Vulgar) will saie, when it sees that after the end of so many yeeres (as are spent since I first slept in the bosome of obliuion) I come out loaden with my gray haires and bring with me a booke as dry as a kexe, void of inuention, barren of good phrase, poor of conceipts, and altogether empty both of learning &amp; eloquence: without quotations on the margents, or annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the end of the book, wherwith I see other books are still adorned be they neuer so idle, fabulous, and prophane: so full of sentences of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> and the other crew of the Philosophers, as admires the Readers, &amp; makes them beleeue that these Authors are very learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. And after whē they cite <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> what can they say, but that they are the sayings of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> or other Doctors of the Church: obseruiug herein so ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Methode, as in one line they will paint you an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured gull, and in the other will lay you downe a little see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming deuout sermon, so that it is a great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to reade or heare it, all which things must bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my booke, for neither haue I any thing to cite on the margent, or note in the end, and much lesse doe I know what Authors I follow, to put them at the beginning as the custome is, by the letter of the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> beginning with
<pb facs="tcp:173111:6"/>
               <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and ending in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or in <hi>Zoylus</hi> or <hi>Zeuxis.</hi> Although the one was a Railer, and the other a Painter. So likewise shall my booke want sonnets at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, at least such sonnets, whose Authors bee Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Bishops, Ladies or famous Poets. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if I would demand them of two or three Artificers of mine acquaintance I know they would make mee some such, as those of the most renowned in <hi>Spaine,</hi> would in no wise be able to equall or compare with them.</p>
            <p>Finally good sir, and my very deer friend, (quoth I) I do resolue that <hi>Sir Don-Quixote</hi> remain intombed among the old records of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> vntill heauen ordaine some one to adorne him with the many graces that are yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for I finde my selfe wholy vnable to remedy them, through mine insufficiency and little learning: and also because I am naturally lazye and vnwilling to goe sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for authors to say that, which I can say well enough without them. And hence proceeded the perplexity and extasie wherin you found me plunged. My friend hearing that, and striking himselfe on the fore head, after a long and lowd laughter said: In good faith friend, I haue now at last deliuered my selfe of a long and intricate error wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was possessed all the time of our acquaintance, for hither to I accounted thee euer to be discreet and prudent in all thy actions, but now I see plainely that thou art as farre from that I tooke thee to bee, as Heauen is from the Earth.</p>
            <p>How is it possible, that things of so small moment, and so easie to bee redressed, can haue force to suspend and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp so ripe a wit as yours hath seemed to be, and so fitted to break vp and trample ouer the greatest difficulties that
<pb facs="tcp:173111:6"/> can be propounded. This proceeds not in good sooth from defect of will, but from superfluity of slouth, and penury of discourse, wilt thou see whether that I say bee true or no? Listen then attentiuely a while, and thou shalt perceiue how in the twinkling of an eye, I will confound all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and supply all the wants which do suspend, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright thee from publishing to the world <hi>the History of thy famous Don Qui-xote, the light and mirrour of all Knighthood Errant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Say I pray thee quoth I (hearing what hee had said,) after what manner dost thou thinke to replenish the vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of my feare, and reduce the <hi>Chaos</hi> of my confusion to any cleerenesse and light? and he replied: the first thing whereat thou stopst, of Sonnets, Epigrams, Eglogues &amp;c. (which are wanting for the beginning, and ought to bee written by graue and noble persons) may bee remedied, if thou thy selfe wilt but take a little paine to compasse them, and thou maist after name thē thou pleasest, and father them on <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or the Emperor of <hi>Trapisonde</hi> whom I know were held to be famous Poets, and suppose they were not, but that some pedantes &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous fellowes would backebite thee, and murmure against this truth, thou needst not waigh them two strawes for although they could proue it to be an vntruth, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not they cut off thy hand for it.</p>
            <p>As touching Citations in the margent, and authors out of whom thou mayst collect sentences and sayings, to insert in thy history, there is nothing else to be done, but to bobbe into it some latine sentences, that thou knowest already by rote, or mayst get easily with a litle labour: as for example, when thou treatest of liberty and thraldome, thou mayst
<pb facs="tcp:173111:7"/> cite that, <hi>non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro:</hi> &amp; presently quote <hi>Horace,</hi> or he whosoeuer els that said it on the margent! If thou shouldst speak of the power of death, haue presently recourse to that, of <hi>Pallida mors equo pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres.</hi> If of the instability of friends, thou hast at hand <hi>Cato</hi> freely offering his distichon. <hi>Donec eris foelix multos nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabis amicos. Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.</hi> If of riches, <hi>quantum quisque sua nummorum seruat in arca tantum habet et fidei.</hi> If of loue, <hi>hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.</hi> And so with these latine authorities and other such like, they will at least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thee a good Grammarian, &amp; the being of such a one is of no little honour and profite in this our age. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the addition of annotations in the end of thy booke thou maist boldly obserue this course. If thou namest any Giant in thy booke procure that it bee the Giant Goliah, and with this alone (which almost will cost thee nothing) thou hast gotten a faire anotation, for thou maiest say, The Giant <hi>Golias</hi> or <hi>Goliat</hi> was a <hi>Philistine,</hi> whom the shepheard <hi>Dauid</hi> slew with the blow of a stone in the vale of <hi>Terebinitho,</hi> as is recounted in the booke of Kings, in the Chapter wherein thou shalt finde it written.</p>
            <p>After all this, to shew that thou art learned in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine letters and a Cosmographer, take some occasion to make mention of the riuer <hi>Tagus,</hi> and thou shalt present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde thy selfe stored with an other notable notation, saying the riuer <hi>Tagus</hi> was so called of a king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> it takes it beginning from such a place, and dies in the <hi>Ocean</hi> Seas, kissing first the Walles of the famous Citie of <hi>Lisborne:</hi> And some are of opinion, that the sands

If of whoores or Curtezans, there thou hast the Bishop of <hi>Mondonnedo,</hi> who will lend thee <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Layda,</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> whose annotation will gaine thee no small credit. If of cruell persons, <hi>Ouid</hi> will tender <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi> If of Inchaunters or Witches, <hi>Homer</hi> hath <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipso,</hi> and <hi>Virgil Circe.</hi> If of valorous Captaines, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> shall lend himselfc in his commentaries to thee, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> shall giue thee a thousand <hi>Alexanders.</hi> If thou dost treate of loue, and hast but two ounces of the <hi>Thuscane</hi> language, thou shalt incounter with <hi>Lion</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> who will replenish thy vessels with store in that kind, but if thou wilt not trauaile for it into strange Countries, thou hast here at home in thy house <hi>Fonseca</hi> of the loue of God, wherein is deciphered all that either thou, or the most ingenious capacitie can desire to learne of that subiect. In conclusion, there is nothing else to be done but that thou only indeauour to name those names, or to touch those Histories in thine owne which I haue here related, and leaue the adding of Annotations &amp; citations vnto me, for I doe promise thee that I will both fill vp the margent, and also spend foure or fiue sheetes of aduantage at the end of the Booke.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the citation of Authors, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bookes haue, and thine wanteth, the remedie hereof is very easie, for thou needest doe nought else but seeke out a Booke that doth quote them all from the Letter <hi>A.</hi> vntill <hi>Z.</hi> as thou saidst thy selfe but euen now, and thou shalt set that very same Alphabet to thine own Booke. For although the little necessitie that thou hadst to vse their assistance
<pb facs="tcp:173111:8"/> in thy work, will presently conuict thee of falshood, it maks no matter, and perhaps there may not a few bee found so simple, as to beleeue that thou hast holpe thy selfe in the Narration of thy most simple and sincere Historie, with all their authorities. And though that large Catalogue of Authors doe serue to none other purpose; yet will it at least giue some authoritie to the Booke at the first blush: and the rather, because none will bee so mad as to stand to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether thou dost follow them or no, seeing they can gaine nothing by the matter. Yet if I doe not erre in the consideration of so waightie an affaire, this Booke of thine needes none of all these things, for as much as it is onely an inuectiue against Bookes of Knighthood, a subiect whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> neuer dreamed, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Cicero</hi> neuer heard any word. Nor doe the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities of trueth, nor obseruations of <hi>Astrologie</hi> fall within the Spheare of such fabulous Iestings. Nor doe Geometricall dimensions impart it any thing, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of arguments vsurped by Rhetoricke, nor ought it to Preach vnto any the mixture of holy matters with prophane, (a motley wherewith no <hi>Christian</hi> well should be attyred,) onely it hath neede to helpe it selfe with imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for by how much the more it shall excell therein, by so much the more will the worke bee esteemed. And since that thy labour doth ayme at no more then to diminish the authoritie and acceptance that Bookes of Chiualrie haue in the world, and among the vulgar, there is no occasion why thou shouldest goe begging of sentences from Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, fables from Poets, Orations from Rhetoritians, or myracles from the Saints, but onely endeauour to deliuer with significant, plaine, honest, and welordered words thy
<pb facs="tcp:173111:8"/> Iouiall and cheerefull discourse, expressing as neere as thou maiest possibly thy intention, making thy conceites cleare, and not intricate or darke; and labour also that the melancholy Mare by the reading thereof, may bee vrged to laughter, the pleasant disposition increased, the simple not cloyed; and that the iudicious may admire thy inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the graue not despise it, the prudent applaude it. In conclusion let thy proiect be to ouerthrow the ill compiled <hi>Machina</hi> and bulke of those Knightly Bookes, abhorred by many, but applauded by more. For if thou bring this to passe, thou hast not atchieued a small matter.</p>
            <p>I listned with very great atention to my friends speech, and his reasons are so firmely imprinted in my minde, as without making any replie vnto them, I approued them all for good, and framed my preface of them. Wherein (sweete Reader) thou maiest perceiue my friends discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my happinesse to meete with so good a Councellour at such a pinch, and thine owne ease, in finding so plainely and sincerely related, the Historie of the famous <hi>Don Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> of whom it is the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the inhabitants bordring on the fields of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel,</hi> that he was the most chaste enamoured, and valiant Knight, that hath beene seene, read, or heard of these many ages. I will not indeere the benefit and seruice I haue done thee by making thee acquainted with so Noble and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Knight, but onely doe desire that thou gratifie me for the notice of the famous <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> his Squire, In whom in mine opinion are deciphered all the Squirelike graces dispersed throughout the vaine route of Knightly Bookes. And here withall I bid thee farewell, and doe not forget me. <hi>Vale.</hi>

                  <p>Wherein is rehearsed the calling, and exercises of the renowmed Gentleman <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> of the Mancha.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here liued not long since in a certaine vilage of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the name wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I purposely omit, a Yeoman of their calling that vse to pile vp in their hals olde Launces, Halbards, Morri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such other armours and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. He was besides master of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Target, a leane Stallion, and a swift Grey-hound. His pot consisted daily of somewhat more Beefe then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173111:15"/> Mutton, a little minced meate euery night, griefes and complaints the Saturdayes, Lentils on Fridayes, and now and then a Pigeon of respect on Sundayes; did consume three parts of his rents: the rest and remnant thereof was spent on a Ierkin of fine puke, a paire of veluet hose, with pantofles of the same for the holly-dayes, and one appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the finest vesture; for therewithall he honored and set out his person on the worke dayes. Hee had in his house a woman-seruant, of about some forty yeares old, and a niese not yet twenty, and a man that serued him both in fielde and at home, and could saddle his horse, and likewise manage a pruning hooke. The Master him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was about fifty yeares olde, of a strong complexion, drie flesh, and a withered face: he was an early riser, and a great friend of hunting. Some affirme that his surname was <hi>Quixada</hi> or <hi>Quesada</hi> (for in this there is some vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among the authours that write his life) although it may be gathered by very probable coniectures, that hee was called <hi>Quixana.</hi> Yet all this concernes our historicall relation but little; let it then suffice, that in the narration thereof we will not vary a iot from the truth.</p>
               <p>You shall therefore wit, that this Yeoman abouena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the spirts that he was idle (which was the longer part of the yeare) did apply himselfe wholly to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bookes of bookes Knight-hood, and that with such gusts and delights, as he almost wholly neglected the exercise of hunting, yea and the very administration of his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould affaires: and his curiosity and folly came to that passe, that he made away many acres of arable land to buy him bookes of that kind; and therefore he brought to his house as many as euer he could get of that subiect: and among them all none pleased him better then those which famous <hi>Felician</hi> of <hi>Silua</hi> composed. For the smoothnesse of his prose, with now and then some intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate sentence medled, seemed to him peerlesse; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when he did reade the loue dalliances, or letters
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173111:15"/> of challenge, that Knights sent to Ladies, or one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; where, in many places he found written the reason of the vnreasonablenesse, which against my reason is wrought, doth so weaken my reason, as with all reason I doe iustly complaine on your beauty. And also when he read The high Heauens, which with your diuinity doe fortifie you diuinely with the starres, and make you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueresse of the deserts that your greatnesse deserue, &amp;c. With these and other such passages the poore Gentleman grew distracted, and was breaking his braines day and night to vnderstand and vnbowell their sense. An endles labor, for euen <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe would not vnderstand them, though he were againe resuscitated onely for that purpose. He did not like so much the vnproportionate blowes that <hi>Don Belianis</hi> gaue and tooke in fight; for, as he imagined, were the Surgeons neuer so cunning that cured them, yet was it impossible but that the patient his face &amp; all his body must remaine full of scars, and tokens: yet did he praise notwithstanding in the authour of that History, the conclusion of his booke, with the promise of the endlesse aduenture, and many times he himselfe had a desire to take pen and finish it exactly as it is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; and would doubtlesly haue performed it, and that certes with happy successe, if other more vrgent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall thoughts had not disturbed him.</p>
               <p>Many times did he fall at variance with the Curate of his village (who was a learned man, graduated in <hi>Ciguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca)</hi> touching who was the better Knight <hi>Palmerin</hi> of England, or <hi>Amadis de Gaule:</hi> but Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Barber of the same towne would affirme, that none of both arriued in worth to the Knight of the Sun; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyone Knight might paragon with him, it was infallibly <hi>Don Galaor, Amadis de Gaules</hi> brother, whose nature might fitly be accommodated to anything; for hee was not so coy and whyning a Knight as his brother, and that in matters of valour, he did not bate him an ace.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:173111:16"/>
               <p>In resolution, he plunged himselfe so deepely in his reading of these bookes, as he spent many times in the Lecture of them whole dayes and nights; and in the end through his little sleepe and much reading, he dryed vp his braines in such sort as he lost wholly his iudgement. His fantasie was filled with those things that he read, of enchantments, quarrels, battels, challenges, wounds, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, loues, tempests, and other impossible follies. And these toyes did so firmly possesse his imagination with an infallible opinion, that all that Machina of dreamed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions which he read was true, as he accounted no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in the world to be so certaine and sincere as they were. He was wont to say that the <note n="*" place="margin">A famous Captaine of the Spanish nation.</note>
                  <hi>Cid Ruydiaz</hi> was a very good Knight, but not to be compared to the Knight of the burning sword, which with one thwart blow cut asunder two fierce and mighty Giants. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed better with <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> because he slew the enchanted <hi>Rowland</hi> in <hi>Roncesuales.</hi> He likewise liked of the shift <hi>Hercules</hi> vsed when he smothered <hi>Anteon</hi> the sonne of the earth betweene his armes. He praysed the Gyant <hi>Morgant</hi> maruellously, because though hee was of that monstrous progenie, who are commonly all of them proude and rude, yet he onely was affable and courteous. But he agreed best of all with <hi>Reinauld</hi> of <hi>Mount alban;</hi> and most of all then, when he saw him sallie out of his Castle to rob as many as euer hee could meete: and when moreouer he robd the Idoll of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> made al of gold, as his History recounts, and would be content to giue his soule, yea and his Niese also, for a good oportunity on the traytor <hi>Galalon,</hi> that he might lamb-skin and trample him into powder.</p>
               <p>Finally, his wit being wholly extinguished; he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of the strangest conceits that euer mad-man stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on in this world, to wit, it seemed vnto him very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite and behouefull, as well for the augmentation of his honours, as also for the benefite of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173111:16"/> that he himselfe should become a Knight errant, and goe throughout the world, with his horse and armor to seeke aduentures, and practise in person all that he had read was vsed by Knights of yoare; reuenging of all kinds of iniuries, and offering himselfe to occasions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: which being once happily atchieued, might gaine him eternall renowne. The poore soule did already fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure himselfe crowned, through the valour of his arme, at least with the Empire of <hi>Trapesonda:</hi> and ledde thus by these soothing thoughts, and borne away with the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding delight he found in them, he hastened all that he might, to effect his vrging desires.</p>
               <p>And first of all he caused certaine olde rusty armes to be scoured, that belonged to his great Grand-father, and lay many ages neglected, and forgotten in a by-corner of his house; he trimmed them and dressed them the best he mought, and then perceiued a great defect they had; for they wanted an helmet, and had only a plain morrion: but he by his industry supplied that want, and framed with certaine papers pasted together, a Beauer for his Morrion. True it is, that to make tryall whether his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Beauer was strong enough, and might abide the ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenture of a blow, he out with his sword, and gaue it a blow or two, and with the very first did quite vndoe his whole weekes labour: the facility wherewithall it was dissolued liked him nothing; wherefore to assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe better the next time from the like danger, he made it anew, placing certaine iron barres within it, in so artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, as he rested at once satisfied, both with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, and also the sollidity of the worke; and without making a second tryall, he deputed and held it in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a most excellent Beauer. Then did he presently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit his horse, who though he had more corners then a Spanish Reall, and more faults then <hi>Gonellas,</hi> hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on him but skin and bone; yet he thought that neyther <hi>Alexanders Bucephalus,</hi> nor the <hi>Cid</hi> his horse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173111:17"/>
                  <hi>Balieca,</hi> were in any respect equall to him. He spent foure dayes deuising him a name: for (as he reasoned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) it was not fit that so famous a Knights horse, and chiefly being so good a beast, should want a knowne name; and therefore he endeuoured to giue him such a one, as should both declare what sometime he had been, before he pertayned to a Knight errant, and also what presently he was: for it stood greatly with reason, seeing his Lord and Master changed his estate and vocation, that he should alter likewise his denomination, and get a new one, that were famous and altisonant, as becommed the new order and exercise which he now professed: and therefore after many other names which he framed, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our, rejected, added, vndid, and turned again to frame in his memory and imagination, he finally concluded to name him <hi>Rozinante,</hi> a name in his opinion, lofty, ful, and <note place="margin">A horse of labor or carriage in Spanish is called <hi>Rozin,</hi> and the word <hi>Ante,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Before:</hi> so that <hi>Rozin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante</hi> is a horse that sometime was of carriage.</note> significatiue of what he had beene when he was a simple horse, before he was exalted to his new dignity; being as he thought, the best carriage beast of the world. The name being thus giuen to his horse, and so to his minde, he resolued to giue himselfe a name also, and in that thought he laboured other eight dayes; and in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, called himselfe <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> whence (as is said) the Authours of this most true History deduce, that he was vndoubtedly named <hi>Quixada,</hi> and not <hi>Quesada</hi> as others would haue it. And remembring that the valorous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> was not satisfied onely with the dry name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> but added thereunto the name of his Kingdome and Country, to render his owne more redoubted, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himselfe <hi>Amadis de Gaula;</hi> so he, like a good Knight would adde to his owne, that also of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and call himselfe <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> wherewith it appeared, that he very liuely declared his Image and countrey, which he did honour, by taking it for his surname.</p>
               <p>His armour being scoured, his morrion transformed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173111:17"/> into an helmet, his horse named, and himselfe confirmed with a new name also; he forthwith bethought himselfe that now he wanted nothing but a Lady, on whom hee might bestow his seruice and affection; for the Knight errant that is louelesse, resembles a tree that wants leaues and fruit, or a body without a soule: and therefore hee was wont to say, If I should for my sinnes, or by good hap encounter there abroad with some Giant (as Knights errant doe ordinarily) and that I should ouerthrow him with one blow to the ground, or cut him with a stroke in two halues, or finally ouercom, &amp; make him yeeld to me, would it not be very expedient to haue some Lady, to whom I might present him? And that he entring in her presence do lay himself on his knees before my sweet La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and say vnto her with an humble &amp; submissiue voyce: Madam! I am the Giant <hi>Caraculiambro,</hi> Lord of the Iland called <hi>Malindrania,</hi> whom the neuer-too-much-praysed Knight <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi> hath ouercome in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combat; and hath commaunded to present my selfe to your greatnesse, that it may please your Highnesse to dispose of me according vnto your liking. O! how glad was our Knight when he had made this discourseto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but chiefly when he had found out one, whom he might call his Lady. For, as it is imagined, there dwelled in the next village vnto his Mannor, a young handsome wench, on whom he was sometime in loue, although as is vnderstood, she neuer knew or tooke notice thereof. She was called <hi>Aldonca Lorenco,</hi> and her he thought fittest to intitle with the name of Lady of his thoughts, and searching a name for her that should not vary much from her owne, and yet should draw and aueere some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to that of a Princesse or great Lady, he called her <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> (for there she was borne) a name in his conceit harmonious strange and significatiue, like to all the others that he had giuen to his things.</p>

                  <p>Of the first sally that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made to seeke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese preuentions being made, he would deferre the execution of his designes no longer, being spur'd on the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, by the want which he esteemed his delayes wrought in the world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wrongs that he resolued to right, the harmes he meant to redresse, the excesses he would amend, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses that he would better, and the debts he would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And therefore without acquainting any liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with his intention, he vnseene of any, vpon a certaine morning, somwhat before the day (being one of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest of Iuly) armed himselfe Cap a pie, mounted on <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante,</hi> laced on his il-contriued Helmet, imbraced his Target, tooke his Launce, and by a posterne doore of his base-court issued out to the field, marueilous iocund and content to see with what facility he had commenced his good desires. But scarce had he sallied to the fields when he was suddenly assaulted by a terrible thought, and such a one as did welnigh ouerthrow his former good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; which was, he remembred that he was not yet dub'd Knight, and therefore by the lawes of Knighthood neyther could nor ought to combat with any Knight. And though he were one, yet ought he to weare white armour like a new Knight, without any deuice in his shield, vntill he did win it by force of armes.</p>
               <p>These thoughts did make him stagger in his purposes; but his follies preuayling more then any other reason, he purposed to cause himselfe to be Knighted by the first he met, to the imitation of many others, that did the same, as he had read in the bookes which distracted him. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching white armour, he resolued with the first oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173111:18"/> to scoure his owne so well, that they should rest whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Ermines: and thus he pacified his mind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted his iourney, without chusing any other way then that which his horse pleased, beleeuing that therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the vigor of Knightly aduentures. Our flowrishing aduenturer trauelling thus onward, did parle with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this manner: <q>Who doubts in the ensuing ages, when the true History of my famour actes shall come to light, but that the wiseman who shall write it will begin it when he comes to declare this my first sally so early in the morning, after this manner. <hi>Scarce had the ruddy</hi> Apollo <hi>spread ouer the face of the vast and spacious earth, the golden twists of his beautifull hayres, and scarce had the little enameld birds with their naked tongues sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with sweet and</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Melodious.</note>
                     <hi>mellifluous harmony, the arriuall of Rosie Aurora,</hi> when abandoning her iealous husbands soft couch, shee shewes her selfe to mortall wights through the gates and windowes of the <note n="*" place="margin">His countrey the Mancha.</note>
                     <hi>Manchegall Orizon.</hi> When the famous Knight <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> abandoning the slouthfull plumes, did mount vpon his renouned horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and began to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell through the auncient and notorious fields of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel,</hi> (as indeede he did) and following still on with his Discourse, he said: O! happy the age, and fortunate the time, wherein my famous feats shall be reuealed, feats worthy to be grauen in brasse, carued in marble &amp; deliuered with most curious arte in tables, for a future instruction and memory. And thou wise enchanter, whosoeuer thou beest, whom it shall concerne to be the Chronicler of this strange History, I desire thee not to forget my good horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> mine eternall and inseparable companion in all my iournies and courses.</q> And then as if hee were verily enamoured, he said, <q>O Princesse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> Lady of this captiue heart, much wrong hast thou done me by dismissing me, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching me with the rigorous decree &amp; commandement
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173111:19"/> not to appeare before thy beauty: I pray thee sweete Lady deigne to remember thee of this poore subiected heart, that for thy loue suffers so many tortures.</q> And with these words he inserted a thousand other rauings all after the very same manner that his bookes taught him, imitating as neere as he could their very phrase and language, and did ride therewithall so slow a pace, and the Sunne did mount so swiftly, and with so great heate as it was sufficient to melt his braines if he had had any left.</p>
               <p>He trauelled almost all that day, without encountring any thing worthy the recitall, which made him to fret for anger, for he desired to encounter presently some one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom he might make trial of his inuincible strength. Som authors write that his first aduenture was that of the <hi>Lapicean</hi> straites, others, that of the Winde-mils; but what I could only find out in this affaire, and that which I haue found written in the Annals of the <hi>Mancha</hi> is, that he trauelled all that day long, and at night both he and his horse were tyred, and marueilously prest by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and looking about him on euery side, to see whether he could discouer any Castle or Sheepe-fold, wherein he might retire himselfe for that night, &amp; remedy his wants; he perceiued an Inne, neare vnto the high way wherein he trauelled; which was as welcome a sight to him, as if he had seene a starre, that did addresse him to the porch, if not to the Pallace of his redemption. Then spurring his horse, he hyed all he might towards it, and arriued much about night fall. There stood by chance at the Inne dore, two young women aduenturers likewise, which trauelled toward <hi>Siuill</hi> with certaine Carriers, and did by chance take vp their lodging in that Inne the same eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and for as much as our Knight errant esteemed all which he thought, saw, or imagined, was done or did really passe in the very same forme, as he had read the like in his bookes: forthwith as soone as he espied the Vent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173111:19"/> he fained to himselfe that it was a Castle with foure Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, whereof the Pinacles were of glistring siluer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out omitting the draw-bridge, deepe fosse, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents belonging to the like places: And approching by little and little to the Vent, when he drew neere to it, checking <hi>Rozinante</hi> with the bridle, he rested a while to see whether any dwarse would mount on the battlements to giue warning with the sound of a Trumpet, how some Knight did approach the Castle: but seeing they stayed so long, and also that <hi>Rozinante</hi> kept a coile to goe to his stable, he went to the Inne dore, and there beheld the two distracted wenches, that stood at it, whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently supposed to be two beautifull damzels or louely Ladies, that did solace themselues before the Castle gates. And in this space it befell by change, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Swine-heard as he gathered together his hogges, blew the horne, whereat they are wont to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and instantly <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> imagined it was what he desired, to wit, some dwarse who gaue notice of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall; and therefore with marueilous satisfaction of minde he approched to the Inne and Ladies; who beholding one armed in that manner to draw so neere, with his Launce and Target, they made much hast being greatly affrighted, to get to their lodging. But <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing their feare by their flight, lifting vp his pasted Beauer, and discouering his withered and dusty counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, did accost them with gentle demeanoure &amp; graue words in this manner: <q>Let not your Ladiships flie, nor feare any outrage, for to the order of Knighthood which I doe professe, it toucheth nor appertayneth not to wrong any body, and least of all such worthy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels as your presences denote you to be.</q> The wenches looked on him very earnestly, and did search with their eyes for the visage, which his il-fashioned Beauer did conceale: but when they heard themselues termed dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, a thing so farre from their profession, they could not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173111:20"/> containe their laughter, which was so loude, as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> waxed ashamed thereat, and therefore said to them: <q>Modesty is a comely ornament of the beautifull, and the excessiue laughter that springs from a light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, must be reputed great folly: but I do not obiect this vnto you to make you the more ashamed, or that you should take it in ill part: for my desire is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to do you all the honour and seruice I may.</q> This he spake vnto them in such vncouth words, as they could not vnderstand him, which was an occasion, ioyned with his owne vncomelinesse, to encrease their laughter and his wrath, which would haue past the bounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if the In-keeper had not come out at the instant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man who by reason of his exceeding fatnesse, must needes haue beene of a very peaceable condition, who beholding that counterfeit figure, all armed in so vnsuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble armour, as were his Bridle, Lance, Target, and Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, was very neare to haue kept the damzels company in the pleasant showes of his merriment: but fearing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Machina</hi> and bulke contriued of so various fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures, he determined to speake him fairely, and therfore began to him in this maner: If your worship (Sir Knight) doe seeke for lodging, you may chalke your selfe a bedde (for there is none in this Inne) wherein you shall finde all other things in abundance. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noting the lowlinesse of the Constable of that Fortresse (for such the Inne &amp; In-keeper seemed vnto him) answered, any thing Sir <note n="*" place="margin">Here the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish is <hi>Castella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> that is in the Spanish tongue eyther a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of a Castle, or one borne in Castile.</note> Constable, may serue me; for mine armes are mine ornaments, and battels mine ease, &amp;c. The Hoste thought he had called him a <hi>Castellano</hi> or Constable, because hee esteemed him to be one of the sincere and honest men of Castile, whereas he was indeede an <hi>Andaluzian,</hi> and of the commarke of S. <hi>Lucars,</hi> no lesse thieuish then <hi>Cacus,</hi> nor lesse malicious and crafty then a student or page; and therefore he answered him thus: If that be so, your bedde must be hard rockes, and your sleepe a perpetuall watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173111:20"/> and being such, you may boldly allight, and shall finde certainly here occasion and oportunitie to holde you waking this twelue-moneth, more for one night: and saying so, laid hand on <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> stirrop, who did forthwith allight, though it was with great difficulty and paine (as one that had not eaten all that day one crumme) and then he requested the Hoste to haue speciall care of his horse, saying, he was one of the best pieces that euer eate bread. The In-keeper viewed and reuiew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to whom he did not seeme halfe so good as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> valued him; and laying him vp in the stable, he turned to see what his Guest would command, who was a disarming by both the damzels (which were by this time reconciled to him) who though they had taken off his brest-plate and backe parts, yet knew they not how, nor could any wise vndo his gorget, nor take off his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Beauer, which he had fastened on with greene rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; and by reason the knots were so intricate, it was requisite they should be cut, whereunto he would not in any wise agree; and therfore remained all the night with his helmet on, and was the strangest and pleasantest figure thereby that one might behold. And as he was a disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (imagining those light wenches that holpe him, to be certaine principall Ladies and dames of that Castle) he said vnto them with a very good grace: Neuer was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Knight so well attended on, and serued by Ladies as was <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> when he departed from his village, damzels attended on him, and Princesses on his horse. O <hi>Rozinante,</hi> for (Ladies) that is the name of my horse, and <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha</hi> is mine owne. For although I meant at the first not to haue discouered my selfe, vntill the acts done in your seruice and benefite should manifest me, yet the necessity of accōmodating to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the olde Romaunce of Sir <hi>Launcēlot</hi> hath beene an occasion that you should know my name before the right season: but the time will come wherein your Ladiships
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173111:21"/> may commaund me, and I obey, and then the valor of mine arme shall discouer the desire I haue to doe you seruice.</p>
               <p>The wenches being vnaccustomed to heare so rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall termes, answered neuer a word to him, but onely demaunded, whether he would eate any thing? That I would, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for as much as I thinke the taking of a little meate would be very behoouefull for me. It chanced by hap to be on Friday, and therefore there was no other meat in the Inne, then a few pieces of a fish called in Castile <hi>Abadexo,</hi> in Andaluzia <hi>Bacallao,</hi> and in some places <hi>Curadillo,</hi> and in others <hi>Truchuela,</hi> and is but poore-Iohn. They demanded of him therfore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would eate thereof, giuing it the name vsed in that place of <hi>Truchuela</hi> or little Troute, for there was no other fish in all the Inne to present vnto him but such? Why then quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> bring it in, for if there be many little Trouts, they may serue me in stead of a great one; it being all one to me to be paide my money (if I were to receiue any) in eight single Reals, or to be paide the same in one Reall of eight. And moreouer those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trouts are perhaps like vnto Veale, which is much more delicate flesh then Beefe or the Kid, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Goat: but be it what it list, let it be brought in presently; for the labour and weight of armes cannot be well borne, without the well supplying of the guttes. Then was there straight laid a table at the Inne dore, that he mought take the aire: and the Host brought him a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euil watered, and worse boyled poore-<hi>Iohn,</hi> and a loafe as blacke and hoary as his Harnesse: but the onely sport was to behold him eate: for by reason his helmet was on, and his Beauer lifted, he could put nothing into his mouth himselfe, if others did not helpe him to finde the way; and therefore one of those Ladies serued his turne in that: but it was altogether impossible to giue him drinke after that manner, and would haue remayned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173111:21"/> so for euer, if the In-keeper had not boared a Cane, and setting the one end in his mouth, poured downe the wine at the other: all which he suffered most patiently, because he would not breake the ribbans of his helmet. And as he sate at supper, there arriued by chance a Sow-gelder, who as soone as he came to the Inne did sound foure or fiue times a whistle of Canes, the which did confirme <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that he was in some famous Castle, where he was serued with musicke, and that the poore-Iohn was Trouts, the bread of the finest flower, the whoores Ladies, and the In-keeper Constable of that Castle: Wherefore he accounted his resolution and departure from his owne house very well imployed. But that which did most afflict him, was, that he was not yet dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Knight, for as much as he was fully perswaded that he could not lawfully enterprise or follow any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vntill he receiued the order of Knight-hood.</p>

I did neuer expect lesse (replied <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> from your great magnificence my Lord, and therefore I say vnto you that the boone which I demaund of you, and that hath beene graunted vnto me by your liberality, is, that to morrow in the morning you wil dubbe me Knight, and this night I will watch mine armour in the Chappell of your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and in the morning, as I haue said, the rest of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires shall be accomplished, that I may goe in due manner throughout the foure parts of the world to seeke aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the benefit of the needy, as is the duety of Knight-hood and of Knights errant, as I am, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are wholly inclined and dedicated to such atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173111:22"/> many pupils, and finally making himselfe knowne and famous in all the Tribunals and Courts almost of all Spaine, and that at last he had retired himselfe to that his Castle, where he was sustained with his owne and other mens goods; entertayning in it all Knights errants, of whatsoeuer quality and condition they were, onely for the great affection he bore towards them, and to the end they might diuide with him part of their winnings in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his good will: he added besides, that there was no Chappell in his Castle, wherein he might watch his armes, for he had broken it downe to build it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new: but notwithstanding he knew very well that in a case of necessity, they might lawfully be watched in any other place, and therefore hee might watch them that night in the base Court of the Castle; for in the morning, and pleased God, the ceremonies requisite should bee done in such sort, as he should remaine a dubbed Knight, in so good fashion, as in all the world he could not be bettered. He demaunded of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> whether he had any money? who answered that he had not a blanck, for he had neuer read in any History of Knights errants, that any one of them euer caried any money. To this his Hoste replied, that he was deceiued; for admit that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories made no mention thereof, because the authours of them deemed it not necessary to expresse a thing so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and needfull to be carried as was money and cleane shirts: it was not therefore to be credited, that they had none; and therefore he should hold for most certaine and manifest, that all the Knights errant, with the story of whose acts so many bookes are replenished and heaped, had their purses well lined for that which might befall, and did moreouer carie with them a litle Casket of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and salues, to cure the wounds which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; for they had not the commodity of a Surgeon to cure them, euery time that they fought abroad in the fields and desarts, if they had not by chaunce some wise
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173111:23"/> Enchanter to their friend, who would presently succour them, bringing vnto them in some cloude through the ayre some damzell or dwarfe, with a Violl of water of so great vertue, as tasting one droppe therof, they remained as whole of their sores and wounds, as if they had neuer receiued any. But when they had not that benefite, the Knights of times past held it for a very commendable and secure course, that their Squires should be prouided of money and other necessary things, as linte, and oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for to cure themselues: and when it befell that the like Knights had no Squires to attend vpon them (which hapned but very seldome) then would they themselues carie all this prouision behinde them on their horses, in some slight and subtile wallets, which could scarce be perceiued, as a thing of very great consequence. For if it were not vpon such an occasion, the cariage of wallets was not very tollerable among Knights errāt. And in this respect he did aduise him, seeing he might yet commaund him as one that by receiuing the order of Knight-hood at his hands, should very shortly become his God-childe, that he should not trauell from thence forward without money, and other the preuentions he had then giuen vnto him; and he should perceiue himselfe how behoouefull they would proue vnto him, when he least expected it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> promised to accomplish all that he had counselled him to doe, with all punctuality; and so order was forthwith giuen how he should watch his armes in a great yard that lay neere vnto one side of the Inne: wherefore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> gathering all his armes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, laid them on a Cisterne that stood neer vnto a Well: and buckling on his Target, he laid hold on his Launce and walked vp and downe before the Cisterne very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely; and when he began to walke the night likewise, began to lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke vp the splendor of the day. The In-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the meane season recounted to all the rest that lodged in the Inne the folly of his guest, the watching of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173111:23"/> his armes and the Knighthood which he expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. They all admired very much at so strange a kinde of folly, and went out to behold him from a farre off, and saw that sometimes he pranced too and fro with a quiet gesture; other times leaning vpon his Launce he looked vpon his armour, without beholding any other thing saue his armes for a good space.</p>
               <p>The night being shut vp at last wholly, but with such cleerenesse of the Moone, as it might well compare with his brightnesse that lent her her splendor, euery thing which our new Knight did, was easily perceiued by all the beholders. In this season one of the Carriers that lodged in the Inne resolued to water his Mules, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it was necessary to remooue <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> armour that lay on the Cesterne; who seeing him approach, said vnto him with a loude voice: O thou! whosoeuer thou beest, bold Knight, that commest to touch the armour of the most valorous aduenturer that euer gyrded sword, looke well what thou dost, and touch them not if thou meanest not to leaue thy life in payment of thy presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Carrier made no account of those words (but it were better he had, for it would haue redounded to his benefite) but rather laying hold on the leatherings, threw the armour a prettie way off from him: which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he lifted vp his eyes towards heauen, and addressing his thoughts (as it seemed) to his <q>Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> he said, Assist me deere Lady in this first dangerous scorne and aduenture offered to this breast, that is inthralled to thee, and let not thy fauor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection faile me in this my first Traunce.</q> And vttering these and other such words, he let slip his Target, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his Launce with both hands, he paide the Carrier so round a knocke therewithall on the pate, as he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him to the ground in so euill taking, as if he had seconded it with another, he should not haue needed any Surgeon to cure him. This being ended, he gathered vp
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173111:24"/> his armour againe, and laying them where they had been before, he walked after vp and downe by them, with as much quientnesse as he did at the first.</p>
               <p>But very soone after, another Carrier without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had hapned (for his companion lay yet in a trance on the ground) came also to giue his Mules water, and comming to take away the armes, that he might free the Cesterne of encumbrances, and take water the easier: <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saying nothing, nor imploring fauor of his Mistris or any other, let slip againe his Target, and lifting his Lance, without breaking of it in pieces, made more then three of the second Carriers noddle; for he broke it in foure places. All the people of the Inne, and amongst them the Host likewise repaired at this time to the noise: which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiuing, imbracing his Target, and laying hand on his sword, he said: <q>O Lady of all beauty, courage, and vigour of my weakned heart, it is now high time that thou doe conuert the eyes of thy greatnesse to this thy Captiue Knight, who doth expect so marueilous great an aduenture.</q> Saying thus, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered as he thought so great courage, that if al the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of the world had assayled him, he would not go one steppe backward. The wounded mens fellowes, seeing them so euill dight, from a farre off began to raine stones on <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who did defend himselfe the best hee might with his Target, and durst not depart from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne, least he should seeme to a bandon his armes. The Inkeeper cryed to them to let him alone; for he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready informed them that he was madde, and for such a one would scape scot-free although he had slaine them all. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> likewise cryed out louder, terming them all disloyall men and traytors, and that the Lord of the Castle was a treacherous and badde Knight, seeing he consented that Knights errant should be so basely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and that if he had not yet receiued the order of <q>Knighthood, he would make him vnderstand his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173111:24"/> but of you base and rascally Kenell (quoth he) I make no reckoning at all: throw at me, approach, draw neare, and doe me all the hurt you may, for you shall ere long perceiue the reward you shall carie for this your madnesse and outrage.</q> Which wordes hee spoke with-so great spirit and boldnesse, as hee stroke a terrible feare into all those that assaulted him: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moued both by it, and the Inkeepers perswasions, they left off throwing stones at him, and he permitted them to carie away the wounded men, and returned to the guard of his armes, with as great quietnesse and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, as he did at the beginning.</p>
               <p>The Inkeeper did not like very much these jests of his guest, and therfore he determined to abbreuiate, and giue him the vnfortunate order of Knighthood forthwith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some other disaster befell: and with this resolution comming vnto him, he excused himself of the insolencies those base fellowes had vsed to him, without his priuity or consent, but their rashnesse, as he said, remayned well chastised: He added how he had already told vnto him, that there was no Chappel in his Castel, and that for what yet rested vnperfected of their intention, it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, because the chiefe point of remayning Knighted, consisted chiefly in blowes of the necke and shoulders, as he had read in the ceremoniall booke of the order, and that, that might be giuen in the very midst of the fieldes; and that he had already accomplished the obligation of watching his armes, which with only two houres watch might be fulfild; how much more after hauing watched foure, as he had done. All this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beleeued, and therfore answered, that he was most ready to obey him, &amp; requested him to conclude with al the breuity possible: for if he saw himselfe Knighted, and were once againe assaulted, he meant not to leaue one person aliue in all the Castle, except those which the Constable should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whom he would spare for his sake.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:173111:25"/>
               <p>The Constable being thus aduertised, and fearefull that he would put this his deliberation in execution, brought out a booke presently, wherein he was wont to write downe the accounts of the straw and Barley, which he deliuered from time to time, to such Carriers as lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Inne, for their beasts: and with a but of a candle which a boy held lighting in his hand before him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the two damzels aboue mentioned, he came to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whom he commanded to kneele vpon his knees, and reading in his <hi>Manual</hi> (as it seemed some deuoute Orison) he held vp his hand in the midst of the Lecture, and gaue him a good blow on the necke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that gaue him an other trimme thwacke ouer the shoulders with his owne sword (alwayes murmuring something betweene the teeth as if he prayed) this being done, he commaunded one of the Ladies to gy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And she answered with great buxomnes, that she was named <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losa,</hi> and was a butchers daughter of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that dwelt in the Rewes of <hi>Sancho Benega,</hi> and that she would euer honour him as her Lord. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replied, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting her for his sake to call her selfe from thence forth the Lady <hi>Tolosa,</hi> which he promised him to performe. The other Lady buckled on his spurre, with whom hee had the very like conference; and asking her name, shee told him shee was called <hi>Molinera,</hi> and was daughter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173111:25"/> to an honest Miller of <hi>Antequera:</hi> here likewise our Knight intreated to call her selfe the Lady <hi>Molinera,</hi> profering her new seruices and fauours. The new and neuer-seene before Ceremonies being thus speedily fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as it seemed with a gallop, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could not rest vntill he were mounted on horse-backe, that hee might goe to seeke aduentures; wherefore causing <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> to be instantly sadled, he leaped on him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his Hoste, he said vnto him such strange things, gratifying the fauour hee had done him in dubbing him Knight, as it is impossible to hit vpon the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them right. The Inkeeper that hee might be quickly rid of him, did answere his wordes with others no lesse rethoricall, but was in his speech somwhat brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and without demanding of him any thing for his lodging, he suffered him to depart in a fortunate houre.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Vrora</hi> began to display her beauties about the time that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> issued out of the Inne, so content, liuely, and jocund to behold himselfe Knighted, as his very horse gyrts were ready to burst for ioy: but calling to memory the counsels that his Hoste had giuen him, touching the most needfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements that he was euer to carie about him, of money and cleane shirts, he determined to returne to his house, and to prouide himselfe of them, and also of à Squire; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account to intertaine a certaine labourer his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who was poore, and had children, but yet one very fit for this purpose, and Squirely function, belonging to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173111:26"/> Knighthood. With this determination he turned <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> towards the way of his owne village, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner his will, began to trotte on with so good a will, as he seemed not to touch the ground. He had not trauelled farre, when hee thought that he heard cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine weake and delicate cryes, like to those of one that complayned to issue out from the thickest of a wood that stood on the right hand. And scarce had he heard them when he said: <q>I render infinite thankes to heauen for the fauour it doth me, by profering me so soone occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, wherein I may accomplish the duety of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and gather the fruits of my good desires: these plaints doubtlesly be of some distressed man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who needeth my fauour and ayde.</q> Then turning the raynes, he guided <hi>Rozinante</hi> towards the place from whence he thought the complaints sallied; and within a few paces after he had entred into the thicket, he saw a Mare tyed vnto an <hi>Holme Oake,</hi> and to another was tied a young youth all naked from the middle vpward of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the age of fifteene yeares, and was he that cried so pittifully: and not without cause; for a certaine Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of comely personage did whip him with a girdle, and accompanied euery blow with a reprehension and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, for he said, the tongue must peace, and the eyes be warie: and the boy answered, I will neuer doe it againe, good Master; for the passion of God, I will neuer doe it againe. And I promise to haue more care of your things from henceforth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> viewing all that passed, said with an angry voyce: <q>Discourteous Knight, it is very vncomely to see thee deale thus, with one that cannot defend himselfe, leape therefore a horse-backe, and take thy Launce (for the Farmer had also a Launce leaning to the very same tree, whereunto his Mare was tied) for I will make thee know, that it is the vse of Cowards to doe that which thou dost.</q> The other beholding such
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173111:26"/> an Anticke to houer ouer him, all laden with armes, and brandishing of his Launce towards his face, made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that hee should be slaine, and therefore he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with very milde and submissiue wordes, saying, Sir Knight, the boy which I chastise is mine owne seruant, and keepeth for me a flocke of sheepe in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke; who is growne so negligent, as hee looseth one of them euery other day, and because I correct him for his carelesnesse and knauery, he sayes I doe it through coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesle and pinching, as meaning to defraude him of his wages; but before God and in conscience he belies me. <q>What? The lie, in my presence rascally clowne? Quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> by the Sunne that doth kindle this world, I am about to runne thee thorow and thorow with my Launce base Carle; pay him instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without more replying, or else by that God which doth mannage our sublunar affaires, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thee, and annihilate thee in a moment; loose him forthwith.</q> The Countrey-man hanging downe of his head, made no replie, but loosed his seruant; of whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded how much did his Master owe vnto him? hee said, one moneths hire, at seuen Reals a moneth. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made then the account, and found that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to seuenty and three Reals, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commaunded the Farmer to pay the money pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, if hee meaned not to die for it. The fearefull Countrey-man answered, that by the trance wherein he was then, and by the oath he had made (which was none at all, for hee swore not) that hee ought not so much: for there should bee deducted out of the accounts three paire of shoes hee had giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and a Reall for twise letting him bloud, being sicke. All is well, quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> but let the price of the shoes and letting bloud, goe for the blowes which thou hast giuen him without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

The damage is Sir Knight, replied the boyes Master, that I haue no money here about me. Let <hi>Andrew</hi> come with me to my house, and I will pay him his wages, one Reall vpon another. I goe with him, quoth the boy. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill befall me then. No Sir, I neuer meant it; for as soone as euer he were alone, he would fley me like S. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew.</hi> He will not dare to do it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for my commaund is sufficient to make him respect me, and so that he will sweare to me to obserue it by the order of Knighthood which he hath receiued, I will set him free, and assure thee of the payment. Good Sir, quoth the youth, marke well what you say, for this man my Master is no Knight, nor did euer receiue any order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for he is <hi>Iohn Haldudo</hi> the rich man, a dweller of <hi>Quintanar.</hi> That makes no matter, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for there may be Knights of the <hi>Haldudos:</hi> and what is more, euery one is sonne of his workes. That's true, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> but of what workes can this my Master be sonne, seeing he denies me my wages, and my sweate and labour? I doe not denie thy wages friend <hi>Andrew,</hi> quoth his Master; doe me but the pleasure to come with me, and I sweare by all the orders of Knighthood that are in the world, to pay thee as I haue said, one Reall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon another, yea and those also perfumed. <q>For the perfuming I thanke thee, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> giue it him in Reals, and with that I will rest satisfied; and see that thou fulfillest it as thou hast sworne: if not, I swear againe to thee by the same oath to returne and search thee, and chastise thee, and I will finde thee out, though thou didst hide thy selfe better then a <hi>Lizarde:</hi> and if thou desirest to note who commaunds thee this, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173111:27"/> thou mayest remaine more firmely obliged to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish it, know that I am the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the righter of wrongs and vndoer of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and so farewell: and doe not forget what thou hast promised and sworne on paine of the paines alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pronounced.</q> And saying these wordes, he spurred <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and in short space was got farre off from them. The Countrey-man pursued him with his eye, and perceiuing that he was past the wood and quite out of sight, he returned to his man <hi>Andrew,</hi> and said to him come to me childe, for I will pay thee what I owe thee, as that righter of wrongs hath left me commanded. That I sweare, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> and you shall deale discreetely in fulfilling that good Knights commaundement, who I pray God may liue a thousand yeares: for seeing he is so valorous and so iust a Iudge I swear by <hi>Rocque,</hi> that if you pay me not, he shall returne and execute what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. I also doe sweare the same quoth the Farmer, but in respect of the great affection I beare vnto thee I wil aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the debt, to increase the payment; and catching the youth by the arme, he tied him againe to the Oake, where he gaue him so many blowes as he left him for dead. Call now Master <hi>Andrew</hi> (quoth he) for the righter of wrongs, and thou shalt see that he cannot vndo this, although I beleeue it is not yet ended to be done. For I haue yet a desire to flea thee aliue, as thou didst thy selfe feare. Not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding all these threats, he vntied him at last, and gaue him leaue to goe seeke out his Iudge; to the end he might execute the sentence pronounced. <hi>Andrew</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted somewhat discontent, swearing to search for the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> and recount vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him point by point all that had past, and that he should pay the abuse with vsury: but for all his threats he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted weeping, and his Master remained behinde laughing; and in this manner the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> redresse that wrong.</p>

               <p>Who glad aboue measure for his successe, accounting himselfe to haue giuen a most noble beginning to his seats of armes, did trauell towards his village, with very great satisfaction of himselfe, and said in a low tune these wordes ensuing: <q>Well maist thou call thy selfe happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other women of the earth, O! aboue all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beautifull <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Tobosa,</hi> since thy good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was such, to hold subiect and prostrate to thy will and desire so valiant and renouned a Knight as is; and euer shall be, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha:</hi> who, as all the world knowes, receiued the order of Knighthood but yesterday, and hath destroyed to day the greatest outrage and wrong that want of reason could forme, or cruelty commit.

               <p>In this discourse he aimed to a way which diuided it selfe into foure, and presently these thwarting crosse wayes represented themselues to his imagination, which oft-times held Knights errant in suspence, which way they should take; and that hee might imitate them hee stood still a while, and after he had bethought himselfe well, he let slip the raines to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> subiecting his will to that of his horse, who presently pursued his first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, which was to returne home vnto his owne stable: and hauing trauelled some two miles, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered a great troupe of people, who as it was after knowne, were certaine Merchants of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that rode towards <hi>Murcia</hi> to buy silkes: they were sixe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and came with their <note n="*" place="margin">A thing made like a Canopy, and is vsed by Trauellers to keepe away the Sunne.</note>
                  <hi>Quitasoles</hi> or shadowes of the Sunne, foure Seruing-men a horse-backe, and three Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keyes. Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiued them, when he straight imagined them to be a new aduenture: and because he would imitate as much as was possible the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which he read in his bookes, he represented this to himselfe to be iust such an aduenture as hee purposed to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173111:28"/> archieue. And so with comely gesture and hardinesse, setling himselfe well in the stirrops, he set his Launce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his rest; and imbraced his Target, and placing himselfe in the midst of the way, he stood awayting when those Knights errant should arriue; for now hee iudged and tooke them for such: and when they were so neare as they might heare and see him, he lifted vp his voyce, and said: <q>Let all the world stand and passe no further, if all the world will not confesse, that there is not in all the world a more beautifull damzell then the Empresse of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the peerelesse <hi>Dulomea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi>
                  </q> The Merchants stayed at these wordes to behold the maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ridiculous shape of him that spake them, and by his fashion and them ioynd, did incontinently gather his folly and distraction, and notwithstanding would leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold to what tended that confession which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of them; and therefore one of them who was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what giuen to gibing, and was withall very discreete, said vnto him, Sir Knight, we doe not know that good I ady of whom you speake; shew her therefore to vs, and if she be so beautiful as you affirme, we will willingly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compulsion confesse the truth, which you now demaund of vs. If I did shew her to you, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> without mastrie were it then for you to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a truth so notorious? The consequence of mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs consists in this, that without beholding her, you doe beleeue, confesse, affirme, sweare and desend it; which if you refuse to performe, I challenge you all to battell, proude and vnreasonable folke, and whether you come one by one (as the order of Knighthood requires) or all at once, as is the custome and dishonourable practise of men of your broode: here will I expect and awaite you all, trusting in the reason which I haue on my side. Sir Knight, replied the Merchant, I request you in all these Princes names, as many as we be here, that to the end we may not burden your consciences, confessing a thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173111:29"/> which we neuer beheld nor heard, and chiefly being so preiudiciall to the Empresses and Queenes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Alcarria</hi> and <hi>Estremadura,</hi> you will please to shew vs some portraiture of that Lady, although it be no bigger then a graine of Wheate; for by one thread wee may iudge of the whole clew, and we will with this fauor rest secure and satisfied, and you likewise remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and appaide. And I doe beleeue moreouer that we are already so inclined to your side, that although her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture shewed her to be blinde of the one eye, and that Vermillion distilled from the other were brimstone, yet we would notwithstanding to please you say in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour all that you listed. There drops not infamous Kenell! quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> all inflamed with choler; there drops not, I say, from her that which thou sayest, but <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>Ciuet</hi> among bombase; and she is not blinde of an eye, or crooke-backt, but is straighter then a spindle of <hi>Guadarama:</hi> but all of you together shall pay for the great blasphemy thou hast spoken against so immense a beautie, as is that of my Mistresse. And saying so, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based his Launce against him that had answered with such furie and anger, as if good fortune had not so orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, that <hi>Rozinante</hi> should stumble, and fal in the midst of the Carrier, it had gone very ill with the bolde Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. <hi>Rozinante</hi> fell in fine, and his Master reeled ouer a good piece of the field: and though he attempted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, yet was he neuer able, he was so encumbred by his Launce, Target, Spurs, Helmet, and his weighty olde ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. And in the meane while that he striued to arise and could not, he cried, flie not cowardly folke, abide base people, abide, for I lie not here through mine owne fault, but through the defect of my horse.</p>
               <p>One of the Lackeyes which came in the company, and seemed to be a man of none of the best intentions, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the poore ouerthrown Knight speake such insolent words, could not forbeare them, without returning him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173111:29"/> an answere on his ribbes: and with that intention ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him he tooke his Launce, and after he had broken it in pieces, he gaue <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> so many blows with one of them, that in despite of his armour he thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him like a sheafe of wheate. His Masters cried to him, commaunding him not to beate him so much, but that he should leaue him: but all would not serue, for the youth was angry, and would not leaue off the play vntill he had auoyded the rest of his choler. And therefore running for the other pieces of the broken Launce, he broke them all on the miserable falne Knight, who for all the tempest of blowes that rained on him, did neuer shut his mouth, but threatned heauen and earth, and those <note n="*" place="margin">Malandrines.</note> Murderers; for such they seemed to him. The Lackey tyred himselfe at last, and the Merchants followed on their way, carying with them occasion enough of talke of the poore bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured Knight: who when he saw himselfe alone, turned againe to make tryall whether he might arise; but if hee could not doe it when he was whole and sound, how was it possible he being so brused and almost destroyed? And yet he accounted himselfe very happy, perswading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that his disgrace was proper and incident to Knights errant, and did attribute all the fault to his horse, and could in no wise get vp, all his body was so <note n="*" place="margin">Brumado.</note> bruised and loaden with blowes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt seeing in effect that he could not stirre himselfe, he resolued to haue recourse to his ordinary remedy, which was to think on some passage of his Histories &amp; in the instant his folly presented to his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that of <hi>Valdouinos,</hi> and the Marquesse
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173111:30"/> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> then when <hi>Carclote</hi> had left him wounded in the mountaine. A History knowne by children, not hidden to young men, much celebrated, yea, and beleeued by many olde men; and is yet for all that no more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, then are <hi>Mahomets</hi> miracles. This History as it seemed to him, was most fit for the traunce wherein hee was, and therefore he began with signes of great paine to tumble vp and downe, and pronounce with a languishing breath the same that they faine the wounded Knight to haue said in the wood:</p>
               <q>Where art thou Lady deere! that grieu'st not at my smart? Or thou dost it not know, or thou disloy all art.</q>
               <p>And after this manner he did prosecute the olde song vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till these verses that say: O noble Marquesse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> my carnall Lord and vncle. And it befell by chance that at the very same there past by the place where he lay a man of his owne village, who was his neighbour, and returned after hauing caried a loade of wheate to the mill: who beholding a man stretched on the ground, he came ouer to him, and demaunded what he was, and what was it that caused him to complaine so dolefully? <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did verily beleeue that it was his vncle the Marquesse of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> and so gaue him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere, but only followed on in the repetition of his old Romaunce, wherein he gaue him account of his disgrace, and of the loue the Emperours sonne bore to his Spouse, all in the very same manner that the Ballad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it. The labourer remained much astonished, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those follies; and taking off his vizard which with the Lackeyes blowes was broken all to pieces, he wiped his face that was full of poulder; and scarce had he done it when he knew him, to whom he said; Master <hi>Quixada,</hi> for so he was probably called when he had his wits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left the state of a staide-Yeoman, to become a wandring Knight) who hath vsed you after this manner? But he continued his Romance, answering out of it, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173111:30"/> question that was put to him. Which the good man perceiuing disarmed him the best hee could, to see whether hee had any wound, but he could see no bloud, or any token on him of hurt. Afterward hee endeuoured to raise him from the ground; which hee did at last with much adoe; and mounted him on his Asse, as a beast of easiest cariage. He gathered then together all his armes, and left not behinde as much as the splinters of the Launce, and tied them all together vpon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> whom hee tooke by the bridle, and the Asse by his halter, and ledde them both in that equipage faire and easily towards his village, being very pensatiue to heare the follies that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> spoke. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was no lesse melancholy, who was so beaten and bruised, as he could very hardly holde himselfe vpon the Asse; and euer and anon he breathed forth such grieuous sighes, as he seemed to fixe them in heauen; which moued his neighbour to intreat him againe to declare vnto him the cause of his griefe. And it seemes none other, but that the very Diuell himselfe did call to his memorie, Histories ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to his successes. For in that instant, wholly forgetting <hi>Valdouinos,</hi> hee remembred the Moore <hi>Abindaraez</hi> then, when the Constable of <hi>Antequera Rodericke Naruaez</hi> had taken him, and caried him prisoner to his Castle. So that when his neighbour turned againe to aske of him how hee did, and what ailed him, he answered the very same wordes and speech that Captiue <hi>Abencerrase</hi> said to <hi>Naruaez,</hi> iust as hee had read them in <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of <hi>Montemayor,</hi> where the History is written; applying it so properly to his purpose, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer grew almost madde for anger to heare that Machina of follies: by which hee collected that his neighbour was distracted, and therefore hee hied as fast as possible hee could to the village, that so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173111:31"/> hee might free himselfe from the vexation that <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> idle and prolixe discourse gaue vnto him. At the end whereof the Knight said, <hi>Don Rodericke</hi> of <hi>Naruaez,</hi> you shall vnderstand that this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <hi>Xarifa,</hi> of whome I spoke, is now the faire <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> for whom I haue done, I doe, and will doe such famous actes of Knighthood, as euer haue beene, are, and shall be seene in all the world. To this his neighbour answered, doe not you perceiue Sir, sinner that I am, how I am ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Don Rodericke de Naruaez,</hi> nor the <hi>Marquesse of Mantua,</hi> but <hi>Peter Alonso</hi> your neighbour; nor are you <hi>Valdouinos,</hi> nor <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> but the honourable Yeoman Master <hi>Quixada.</hi> I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well who I am quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and also. I know that I may not onely be those whome I haue named, but also all the twelue Peeres of <hi>Fraunce;</hi> yea and the nine worthies since mine actes shall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe all those that euer they did together, or euery one of them apart.</p>
               <p>With these and such other Discourses they arriued at last at their village about Sunne-set; but the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer awayted vntill it waxed somewhat darke, because folke should not view the Knight so simply mounted. And when he saw his time, he entred into the towne, and went to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> house, which hee found full of confusion. There was the Curate and the Barber of the village, both of them <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> great friends. To whom the olde woman of the house said in a lamentable manner; What doe you thinke Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Licenciate <hi>Pero Perez</hi> (for so the Curate was called) of my Masters misfortune? These sixe dayes, neyther hee nor his horse haue appeared, nor the Target, Launce, or Armour: vnfortunate woman that I am, I doe suspect, and I am as sure it is true, as that I shall die; how those accursed bookes of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173111:31"/> Knighthood which he hath, and is wont to reade ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, haue turned his iudgement; for now I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I haue heard him say oftentimes, speaking to himselfe, that hee would become a Knight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and goe seeke aduentures throughout the world. Let such bookes bee recommended to <hi>Sathan</hi> and <hi>Barrabas,</hi> which haue destroyed in this sorte the most delicate vnderstanding of all the <hi>Mancha.</hi> His Niese affirmed the same, and did adde, moreouer you shall vnderstand good Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> (for so hight the Barber) that it many times befell my vncle to continue the Lecture of those vnhappy bookes of disuentures two dayes and two nights together. At the ende of which throwing the booke away from him, hee would lay hand on his sword; and would fall a slashing of the walles: and when hee were wearied, hee would say that hee had slaine foure Giants, as great as foure Towers, and the sweate that dropped downe through the labour hee tooke, hee would say was bloud that gushed out of those woundes which he had receiued in the conflict, and then would hee quaffe off a great potte full of colde water, and straight hee did become whole and quiet, saying, that water was a most precious drinke, which the wise man <hi>Esquife,</hi> a great Inchanter or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, and his friend had brought vnto him. But I am in the fault of all this, who neuer aduertised you both of mine Vncles rauing, to the end you might haue redrest it, ere it came to these termes, and burnt all those excommunicated bookes; for hee had many that deserued the fire as much as if they were Hereticall. That doe I likewise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, quoth Master Curate, and in sooth to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowshall not passe ouer vs, without making a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique processe against them, and condemne them to bee burned in the fire, that they may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173111:32"/> occasion againe to such as may reade them, to doe that which I feare my good friende hath done.</p>
               <p>The labourer and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood hearing all that which was said, and then hee perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the disease of his neighbour; and therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crie aloude: open the doores to Lord <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douinos,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Marquesse of Mantua,</hi> who comes very sore wounded and hurt, and to the Lord Moore <hi>Abindaraez,</hi> whom the valorous <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Naruaez</hi> Constable of <hi>Antequera</hi> brings as his prisoner. All the housholde ran out hearing these cries, and some knowing their friend; the others their Master and Vncle, who had not yet alighted from the Asse, because hee was not able, they ranne to embrace him; but he forbad them, saying, stand still and touch me not, for I returne very so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

See in an ill houre (quoth the olde woman straight way) if my heart did not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well foretell me on which foote my Master hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: come vp in good time, for wee shall knowe how to cure you well enough, without sending for that <hi>Vrganda</hi> you haue mentioned, Accursed say I once againe, and a hundred times accursed may those bookes of Knighthood bee which haue brought you to such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. With that they bore him vp to his bedde, and searching for his wounds could not finde any; and then he said all was but bruising, by reason of a great fall hee had with his horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> as he sought with ten Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the most vnmeasurable and boldest that might bee found in a great part of the earth. Hearken, quoth the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, we haue also Giants in the dance; by mine honesty I will burne them all before to morrow at night. Then did they aske a thousand questions of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:173111:32"/> but hee would answere to none of them; and onely requested them to giue him some meate, and suffer him to sleepe, seeing rest was most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for him. All which was done, and the Curate informed himselfe at large of the labouring man: in what sort hee had found <hi>Don Quixote;</hi> which hee recounted to him, and also the follies hee said, both at his finding and bringing to towne; which did kindle more earnestly the Licenciats desire to doe what he had resolued the next day; which was to call his friend the Barber M. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> with whom he came to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> house.</p>

All of them entred into it, and among the rest the olde woman, wherein, they found more then a hundred great volumes, and those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well bound, beside the small ones. And as soone as the olde woman had seene them, she departed very hastily out of the chamber, and eftsoones returned with as great speed, with a holy water pot and a sprinckler in her hand, and said, Hold M. Licenciat and sprinckle this chamber all about, least there should lurke in it some one Inchanter of the many which these bookes containe, and bewitch vs in reuiling of the many paines wee meane to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on these bookes, by banishing them out of this world. The simplicity of the good olde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:173111:33"/> caused the Licentiat to laugh: who commanded the Barber to fetch him downe the bookes from their shelues, one by one, that he might peruse their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for it might happen some to be found, which in no sort deserued to be chastised with fire. No, replyed the Niese, no, you ought not to pardon any of them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue all beene offendors; it is better you throw them all into the base court, and there make a pile of them, and then set them a fire; if not, they may be carried into the yard, and there make a bon-fire of them, and the smoake will offend no body. The olde woman said as much, both of them thirsted so much for the death of these innocents, but the Curate would not condiscend thereto, vntill he had first read the titles at the least of euerie booke.</p>
               <p>The first that Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> put into his hands, was that of <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule;</hi> which the Curate perusing a while, this comes not to me first of all others, without some mysterie: for as I haue heard tolde, this is the first booke of Knighthood that euer was printed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and all the others haue had their beginning and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from this; and therefore me thinkes that we must condemne him to the fire, without all remission, as the <hi>Dogmatizer</hi> and head of so badde a sect. Not so, fie quoth the Barber, for I haue heard that it is the very best contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued booke of all those of that kinde, and therefore he is to be pardoned as the onely complete one of his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That is true, replied the Curate, and for that reason we doe giue him his life for this time. Let vs see that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which lies next vnto him. It is, quoth the Barber, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Las Sergas. pag. 73.</note>
                  <hi>Aduentures of Splandian Amadis of Gaules</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten sonne: Yet on mine honesty, replyed the Curate, his fathers goodnesse shall nothing auaile him, take this booke old Masters, and opening the window throw it downe into the yard, and let it lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our heape for the fire we meane to make. She did
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173111:33"/> what was commaunded with great alacrity, and so the good <hi>Splandian</hi> fledde into the yard, to expect with all patience the fire which he was threatned to abide. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, quoth the Curate. This that comes now, said the Barber, is <hi>Amadis of Greece,</hi> and as I coniecture all those that lie on this side, are of the same linage of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Then let them go all to the yard, quoth the Curate, in exchange of burning Queene <hi>Pintiquinestra,</hi> and the sheepheard <hi>Darinel,</hi> with his Eglogues, and the subtile and intricate Discourses of the Author, which are able to intangle the father that ingendred me, if he went in forme of a Knight errant. I am of the same opinion, quoth the Barber, and I also said the Niese. Then since it is so, quoth the olde wife, let them come, and to the yard with them all. They were rendred all vp vnto her, which were many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: wherefore to saue a labour of going vp and downe the staires, she threw them out at the window.</p>
               <p>What bundle is that, quoth the Curate? This is, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Master <hi>Nicholas, Don O liuante of Laura.</hi> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that booke, quoth the Curate, composed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>The Garden of flowres,</hi> &amp; in good sooth I can scarce resolue which of the two workes is truest, or to speake better, is lesse lying: onely this much I can determine; that this must goe to the yard, being a booke foolish and arrogant. This that followes is <hi>Florismarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> quoth the Barber. Is Lord <hi>Florismarte</hi> there? then replied the Curate, then by mine honesty hee shall briefly make his arrest in the yard, in despite of his wonderfull birth and famous aduentures; for the drouth and harshnesse of his stile deserues no greater fauour. To the yard with him, and this other, (Good Masters) with a very good will Sir, quoth olde <hi>Mumpsimus;</hi> and straightway did execute his commaundement with no small gladnesse. This is Sir <hi>Platyr</hi> (quoth the Barber). It is an ancient booke, replyed the Curate, wherein I finde nothing meriting pardon, let him without any replie keepe company with the rest.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173111:34"/> Forth with it was done. Then was another book opened, and they saw the title thereof to be <hi>The Knight of the Crosse.</hi> For the holy title which this booke beareth, quoth the Curate, his ignorance might be pardoned: but it is a common saying: <hi>The Diuell lurkes behinde the Crosse:</hi> wherefore let it goe to the fire. The Barber ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another booke, said: this is <hi>The Mirrour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> I know his Worship well, quoth the Curate. There goes among those bookes I see the <hi>Lord Raynald of Montalban</hi> with his friends and companions, all of them greater theeues then <note n="*" place="margin">A thiefe that vsed to steale cattell and pull them backeward by the tayles, that none might trace them.</note>

Out of which the Christian Poet <hi>Lodouicke Ariosto</hi> did likewise weaue his worke, which if I can find among these, and that hee speakes not his owne natiue tongue, I'le vse him with no respect, but if he talke in his owne language, I will put him for honours sake on my head. If that be so quoth the Barber, I haue him at home in the Italian, but cannot vnderstand him. Neither were it good you should vnderstand him, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curate, and here we would willingly haue excused the good Captaine that translated it into Spanish from that labour, or bringing it into <hi>Spaine</hi> if it had pleased himselfe. For he hath depriued it of much naturall worth in the translation; a fault incident to all those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to translate Verses out of one language into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for though they imploy all their industry and wit therein, they can neuer arriue to the height of that Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue conceit, which they bring with them in their first birth. I say therefore that this booke, and all the others that may be found in this Library to treate of French af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires be cast and deposited in some drie Vault, vntill we may determine with more deliberation what we should doe with them: alwayes excepting <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:173111:34"/> which must be there among the rest, and another called <hi>Roncesualles;</hi> for these two comming to my handes, shall be rendred vp to those of the old guardian, and from hers into the fires, without any remission. All which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Barber, who did ratifie his sentence, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it for good and discreete, because he knew the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to be so vertuous a man, and so great a friend of the truth, as he would say nothing contrary to it for all the goods of the world.</p>
               <p>And then opening another booke, he saw it was <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin de Oliua,</hi> neere vnto which stood another, intituled <hi>Palmerin of England:</hi> which the Licenciat perceiuing, said, let <hi>Oliua</hi> be presently rent in pieces, and burned in such sort, that euen the very ashes thereof may not be found: and let <hi>Palmerin of England</hi> be preserued, as a thing rarely delectable, and let such another boxe as that which <hi>Alexander</hi> found among <hi>Darius</hi> spoyles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to keepe <hi>Homers</hi> workes, be made for it: for gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip this booke hath sufficient authority for two reasons; the first, because of it selfe it is very good and excellently contriued: the other for as much as the report runnes, that a certain discreete King of <hi>Portingal</hi> was the author thereof. All the aduentures of the Castle of <hi>Miraguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> are excellent and artificiall. The discourses very cleere and courtly, obseruing euermore a <hi>decorum</hi> in him that speakes, with great propriety and conceit, therefore I say Master <hi>Nicholas,</hi> if you thinke good, this and <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> may be preserued from the fire: and let all the rest without further search or regard perish. In the diuels name do not so, gentle gossip (replyed the Barber) for this which I hold now in my hand is the famous <hi>Don Belianis:</hi> What he? quoth the Curate, the second, third, &amp; fourth part thereof haue great neede of some <hi>Ruybarbe</hi> to purge his excessiue choler, and we must moreouer take out of him all that of the <hi>Castell of Fame,</hi> and other impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of more consequence. Therefore wee giue them a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173111:35"/>
                  <hi>terminus Vltramarinus,</hi> and as they shall be corrected, so will we vse mercy or iustice towards them: and in the meane space gossip, you may keepe them at your house, but permit no man to reade them. I am pleased, quoth the Barber, and being vnwilling to tire himselfe any more by reading of Titles, he bad the olde woman to take all the great volumes, and throw them into the yard; the wordes were not spoken to a Mome or deafe person, but to one that had more desire to burne them then to weaue a piece of linnen, were it neuer so great and fine. And therefore taking eight of them together, she threw them all out of the window, and returning the second time, thinking to carie away a great many at once, one of them fell at the Barbers feete, who desirous to know the title, saw that it was <hi>The History of the famous Knight Tirante the white.</hi> Good God, quoth the Curate with a loud voyce, is <hi>Tirante the white</hi> here? Giue me it gossip, for I make account to haue found in it a Treasure of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and a copious Mine of pastime. Here is <hi>Don Quir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleison of Montalban,</hi> a valiant Knight, and his brother <hi>Thomas of Montalban,</hi> and the Knight <hi>Fonseca,</hi> and the combat which the valiant <hi>Detriante</hi> fought with <hi>Alano,</hi> and the witty conceits of the damzell <hi>Plazerdemiuida,</hi> with the loue and guiles of the widow <hi>Reposada,</hi> and of the Empresse enamoured on her Squire <hi>Ipolite.</hi> I say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you gossip, that this booke is for the stile, one of the best of the world: in it Knights doe eate and drinke and sleepe, and die in their beds naturally, and make their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments before their death: with many other things, which all other bookes of this subiect doe want, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, if I might be judge, the authour thereof deserued, because he purposely penned and writ so many follics, to be sent to the Gallies for all the dayes of his life. Carie it home and read it, and you shall see all that I haue said thereof to be true. I beleeue it very well, quoth the Barber. But what shall we doe with these little bookes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173111:35"/> that remaine? These as I take, said the Curate are not bookes of Knighthood, but of Poety; and opening one, he perceiued it was <hi>The Diana of Montemayor,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that all the rest were of that stampe, he said, these deserue not to be burned with the rest, for they haue not, nor can do so much hurt as bookes of Knighthood, being all of them works full of vnderstanding and conceits, and doe not preiudice any other. O good Sir, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his Niese, your reuerence shal likewise do wel to haue them also burned, least that mine vncle after he be cured of his Knightly disease, may fall by reading of these in an humour of becomming a Shepheard, and so wander through the woods, and fieldes singing of Roundelayes, and playing on a high Croude. And what is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then to become a Poet, which is as some say, an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and infectious disease. This maiden saies true, quoth the Curate, &amp; it will not be amisse to remoue this stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block and occasion out of our friends way: and since we begin with the <hi>Diana of Montemayor,</hi> I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it be not burned, but onely that all that which treates of the wise <hi>Felicia,</hi> and of the inchanted water be taken away, and also all the longer verses, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with his proses, and the honour of being the best of that kinde. This that followes, quoth the Barber is the <hi>Diana</hi> called the second, written by him of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> &amp; this other is of the same name, whose author is <hi>Gil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.</hi> Let that of <hi>Salamanea</hi> answered M. Parson, augment the number of the condemned in the yard, &amp; that of <hi>Gil Polo</hi> be kept as charily, as if it were <hi>Apollo</hi> his own work: &amp; go forward speedily good gossip, for it grows late. This booke, quoth the Barber, opening of another, is <hi>The twelue bookes of the fortunes of loue,</hi> written by <hi>Anthony Lofraso,</hi> the <hi>Sardinicall</hi> Poet: By the holy Orders which I haue receiued, quoth the Curate, since <hi>Apollo</hi> was <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and the <hi>Muses Muses,</hi> and <hi>Poets Poets,</hi> was neuer writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so delightfull and extrauagant a worke as this; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173111:36"/> that in his way and vaine, it is the onely one of all the bookes that haue euer issued of that kinde to view the light of the world and he that hath not read it may make account that he hath neuer read matter of delight. Giue it to me gossip, for I doe prize more the finding of it, then I would the gift of a Caslocke of the best. Sattin of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> And so with great ioy he laid it aside, and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber prosecuted, saying, these that follow be, <hi>The sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Iberia: The Nimphes of Enares,</hi> and the <hi>Vndecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Iealousies.</hi> Then there's no more to be done, but to deliuer them vp to the secular arme of the olde wife, and doe not demaund the reason, for that were neuer to make an end. This that comes is <hi>The Sheepheard of Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> That is not a Sheepheard, quoth the Curate, but a very complete Courtier, let it be reserued as a precious jewell. This greate one that followes, is, said the Barber, intituled <hi>The treasure of diuers Poems.</hi> If they had not bin so many, replied the Curate, they would haue been more esteemed. It is necessary that this booke be carded and purged of certaine base things, that lurke among his high conceits. Let him be kept, both because the author is my very great friend, and in regard of other more Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and loftie workes he hath written. This is, said the Barber, <hi>The ditty booke of Lopez Maldonado.</hi> The author of that worke is likewise my great friend, replied the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and his lines pronounced by himselfe doe aduise the hearers, and such is the sweetnesse of his voyce when hee sings them, as it doth inchant the eare. He is somewhat prolix in his <hi>Eglogues,</hi> but that which is good, is neuer su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: let him be kept among the choysest. But what booke is that, which lies next vnto him? <hi>The Galatea of Michel Ceruantes</hi> quoth the Barber. That <hi>Ceruantes,</hi> said the Curate is mine olde acquaintance this many a yeare. And I know he is more practised in misfortunes then in verses. His booke hath some good inuention in it, hee intends and propounds somwhat, but concludes nothing:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173111:36"/> therefore we must expect the second part, which he hath promised, perhaps his amendement may obtaine him a generall remission, which vntill now is denied him, and whilst we expect the sight of his second worke, keep this part closely imprisoned in your lodging. I am very well content to doe so good gossip, said the Barber, and here there come three together, <hi>The Auracana of Don Alonso de Ercilla, The Austriada of Iohn Ruffo,</hi> one of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> and <hi>The Monserrato of Christopher de Virnes</hi> a <hi>Valentian</hi> Poet. All these three bookes, quoth the Curate are the best that are written in heroicall verse in the <hi>Castilian</hi> tongue, and may compare with the most famous of <hi>Italy.</hi> Reserue them as the richest pawnes that <hi>Spaine</hi> enioyeth of Poetry. The Curate with this grew wearie to see so many bookes, and so hee would haue all the rest burned at all aduentures. But the Barber ere the sentence was giuen, had opened by chance one intituled <hi>The Teares of Angelica.</hi> I would haue shed those teares my selfe, said the Curate, if I had wittingly caused such a booke to be burned; for the authour thereof was one of the most famous Poets of the world, not onely of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and was most happy in the translation of certaine fables of <hi>Ouid.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile they were thus busied, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> began to crie aloude, saying, Heere heere valorous Knights, heere it is needfull that you shew the force of your valiant armes; for the Courtiers begin to beare away the best of the Tourney. The folke repayring to this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173111:37"/> and noyse, was an occasion, that any farther speech and visitation of the bookes was omitted, and therefore it is to be suspected, that <hi>The Carolea</hi> and <hi>Lion of Spaine,</hi> with the actes of the Emperour <hi>Charles the fift,</hi> written by <hi>Don Luis de Auila</hi> were burned, without being euer seene or heard; and perhaps if the Curate had seene them, they should not haue past vnder so rigorous a sentence. When they all arriued to <hi>Don Quixote</hi> his chamber, he was risen already out of his bedde, and continued stil his out-cries, cutting and slashing on euery side, being as broadly awake, as if he neuer had slept. Wherfore taking him in their armes, they returned him by maine force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bedde, and after he was somewhat quiet and setled, he said, turning himselfe to the Curate. In good sooth L. Archbishop <hi>Turpin,</hi> it is a great dishonor to vs that are called the twelue Peeres, to permit the Knights of the Court to beare thus away the glory of the Tournay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe; seeing that we the aduenturers haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the prize thereof the three formost dayes. Hold your peace good gossip, quoth the Curate, for fortune may be pleased to change the successe, and what is lost to day, may be wonne againe to morrow: Looke you to your health for the present, for you seeme at least to be very much tyred, if besides you be not sore wounded. Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but doubtlesse I am some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bruised: for that bastard <hi>Don Rowland</hi> hath beaten me to pouder with the stocke of an Oake-tree, and all for enuy, because he sees that I onely dare oppose my selfe to his valour: but let me be neuer againe called <hi>Raynold of Montealban,</hi> if he pay not deerely for it, as soone as I rise from this bedde in despite of all his inchantment. But I pray you call for my breakefast, for I know it will doe me much good, and leaue the reuenge of this wrong to my charge. Presently meat was brought, and after he had eaten he fell a sleepe, and they remained astonished at his wonderfull madnesse. That night the old woman burned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173111:37"/> all the bookes that she found in the house and yard, and some there were burned as that deserued for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse to be kept vp in euerlasting Treasuries, if their fortunes and the lazinesse of the visiters had permitted it. And so the prouerbe was verified in them, That the Iust payes sometimes for Sinners. One of the remedies which the Curate and Barber prescribed for that present, to help their friends disease, was, that they should change his chamber, and damme vp his study, to the end that when he arose, he might not finde them: for perhaps by remouing the cause, they might also take away the effects: and moreouer they bad them to say, that a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter had caried them away Study and all; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was presently put in practise. And within two dayes after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> got vp, and the first thing he did, was to go and visite his bookes; and seeing he could not finde the chamber in the same place, where he had left it, hee went vp and downe to finde it. Sometimes he came to the place where the dore stood, and felt it with his hands, and then would turne his eyes vp and downe, heere and there to seeke it, without speaking a word. But at last af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deliberation, he asked of the olde woman the way to his bookes? Shee as one well schooled before what shee should answere, said, What Study, or what nothing is this you looke for? There is now no more Study nor bookes in this house; for the very Diuell himselfe caried all away with him. It was not the Diuell said his Niese, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter that came here one night vpon a cloude, the day after you departed from hence; and alighting downe from a Serpent vpon which he rode, he entred into the Studie, and what he did therein I know not; and within a while after he fledde out at the roofe of the house, and left all the house full of smoake: and when we accorded to see what he had done, we could neyther see booke or Studie: onely this much the olde woman. And I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well, that the naughty olde man at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173111:38"/> said, with a loude voyce, that he for hidden enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that he bore to the Lord of those bookes had done all the harme to the horse that they might perceiue when he were departed, and added that hee was named the wise <hi>Muniaton Freston,</hi> you would haue said, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I know not quoth the olde woman, whether he hight <hi>Frestron</hi> or <hi>Friton,</hi> but well I wot, that his name ended with <hi>Ton.</hi> That is true quoth <hi>Don-Quioxte,</hi> and he is a very wise Inchanter, and my great aduersary, and lookes on me with a sinister eye, for he knows by his arte and science, that I shal in time fight a single combat with a Knight his very great friend, and ouercome him in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell without being able to be by him assisted, and therfore he labours to doe me all the hurt he may; and I haue sent him word that he striues in vaine to diuert or shunne that which is by heauen already decreed. Who doubts of that quoth his Niese, but I pray you good vncle say, what need haue you to thrust your selfe into these difficulties &amp; brabbles? were it not better to rest you quietly in your owne house, then to wander through the world, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread of <note n="*" place="margin">Buscardo pan de Trastrigo p. 47.</note> blasted corne? Without once considering how many there goe to seeke for wooll, that returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine shorne themselues. O Niese, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how ill dost thou vnderstand the matter? before I permit my selfe to be shorne, I will pill and plucke away the beards of as many as shall dare or imagine to touch but a haire onely of me. To these words the woman would make no replie, because they saw his choler increase.</p>
               <p>Fifteene dayes he remained quietly at home, without giuing any argument of seconding his former vanities: in which time past many pleasant encounters betweene him &amp; his two gossips, the Curate and Barber, vpon that point which he defended, to wit, that the world needed nothing so much as Knights errant, and that the erraticall Knighthood ought to be againe renewed therein. Master Parson would contradict him somtimes, and other times
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173111:38"/> yeeld vnto that he vrged; for had they not obserued that manner of proceeding, it were impossible to bring him to any conformity. In this space <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dealt with a certaine labourer his neighbour, an honest man (if the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of honestly may be giuen to the poore) but one of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shallow wit; in resolution he said so much to him, and perswaded him so earnestly, and made him so large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, as the poore fellow determined to goe away with him, and serue him as his Squire. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> among many other things bad him to dispose himselfe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depart with him, for now and then such an aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might present it selfe, that in as short space as one would take vp a couple of strawes, an Island might be won, and he be left as gouernour thereof. With these and such like promises <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> for so he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, left his wife and children, and agreed to be his Squire. Afterward <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> began to cast plots how to come by some money, which he atchieued by selling one thing, pawning another, and turning all vpside downe. At last he got a prettie summe, and accommodating himselfe with a buckler which he had borrowed of a friend, and patching vp his broken Beauer again as wel as he could, he aduertised his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> of the day and houre wherein he meant to depart, that hee might likewise fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himselfe with that which he thought needfull; but aboue all things he charged him to prouide himselfe of a Wallet; which he promised to performe, and said that he meant also to carie a very good Asse, which he had of his owne, because he was not wont to trauell much a foot. In that of the Asse <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood a while pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, calling to minde whether euer he had read, that any Knight errant carried his Squire Assishly mounted, but he could not remember any authority for it: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he resolued that he might bring his beast, with intention to accommodate him more honourably when occasion were offered, by dismounting the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteous
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173111:39"/> Knight they met from his horse, and giuing it to his Squire, he also furnished himselfe with shirts, and as many other things as hee might, according vnto the In-keepers aduice. All which being finished, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> without bidding his wife or children farewell; or <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his Niese and olde seruant, they both departed one night out of the village vnknowne to any person li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; and they trauelled so farre that night, as they were sure in the morning not to be found, although they were pursued. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> rode on his beast like a <hi>Patriarke</hi> with his Wallet and Bottle, and a maruellous longing to see himselfe gouernour of the Iland which his master had promised vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke by chance the same very course &amp; way that he had done in his first voyage through the field of <hi>Montiel,</hi> wherein he trauelled then with lesse vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the first; for by reason that it was early, and the Sunne beames stroke not directly downe, but athwart, the heat did not trouble them much. And <hi>Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> seeing the oportunity good, said to his Master, I pray you haue care good Sir Knight, that you forget not that gouernment of the Island which you haue promised me, for I shall be able to gouerne it were it neuer so great. To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replied, <q>You must vnderstand friend <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> that it was a custome very much vsed by auncient Knights errant, to make their Squires gouernours of the Islands and Kingdomes that they conquered, and I am resolued that so good a custome shall neuer be abolished by me, but rather I will passe and exceed them therein: for they sometimes, and as I take it, did for the greater part expect vntill their Squires waxed aged, and after they were cloyed with seruice, and had suffered many bad dayes and worse nights, then did they bestow vpon them some title of an Earle, or at least of a <note n="*" place="margin">The title of a Marquesse is lesse then that of at Earle in Spaine.</note> Marquesse of some valley or Prouince, of more or lesse account.</q> But if thou liuest,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173111:39"/> and I withall, it may happen that I might conquer such a Kingdome within sixe dayes, that hath other Kingdomes adherent to it, which would fall out as iust as it were cast in a mould for thy purpose, whom I would crowne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently King of one of them. And doe not account this to be any great matter, for things and chances doe happen to such Knights aduenturers as I am, by so vnexpected and wonderfull wayes and meanes as I might giue thee very easily a great deale more then I promised. After that maner said <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> if I were a King through some miracle of those which you say, then should <hi>Ioan Gutie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> my wife become a Queene, and my children Princes. Who doubts of that, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> That doe I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> for I am fully perswaded, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>God</hi> would raine Kingdomes downe vpon the earth, none of them would sit well on <hi>Mary Gutierez</hi> her head. For Sir, you must vnderstand that shee's not worth a Dodkin for a Queene. To be a Countesse would agree with her better, and yet I pray God shee be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that calling. Commend thou the matter to God, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that hee may giue her that which is most conuenient for her. But do not thou abase thy minde so much, as to content thy selfe with lesse then at least to be a Vice-Roy. I will not good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing I haue so worthy a Lord and Master as your selfe, who knowes how to giue me all that may turne to my benefit, and that I shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discharge in good sort.</p>

What Giants? quoth <hi>Sancho Panca.</hi> Those that thou seest there, quoth his Lorde, with the long armes, and some there are of that race, whose armes are almost two leagues long. I pray you vnderstand, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that those which appeare there, are no Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants but Windemils: and that which seemes in them to be armes, are their Sayles, that are swinged about by the Winde, doe also make the Mill goe. It seemes well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that thou art not yet acquainted with matter of aduentures: they are Giants, and if thou beest a feard, goe aside and pray whilst I enter into cruell and vnequall battell with them. And saying so, he spurd his horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> without taking heed to his Squire <hi>Sanchos</hi> cryes, aduertising him how they were doubtles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Windemils that he did assault, and no Giants; but he went so fully perswaded that they were Giants, as he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard his Squires out-cries, nor did discerne what they were, although he drew very neere to them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173111:40"/> said as loude as he could: Flie not ye cowards and vile creatures, for it is onely one Knight that assaults you. With this the Winde increased, and the Mill Sailes began to turn about; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> espying, said, although thou mouedst more armes then the Giant <hi>Briareo,</hi> thou shalt stoope to me; and after saying this, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe most deuoutly to his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to succour him in that trance, couering himselfe well with his buckler, and setting his Launce on his rest, he spurred on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and encountred with the first Mill that was before him, and striking his Lance into the Saile, the winde swinged it about with such furie, that it broke his Launce into shiuers, carrying him and his horse after it, and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in very euill plight. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> repayred presently to succour him as fast as his Asse could driue: and when he arriued, he found him not able to stirre, hee had gotten such a crush with <hi>Rozinante.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This word <hi>(Ioue)</hi> wil haue no grace in the worke, seeing the actions are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, although otherwise distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in minde, as was <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
                  </note> Good God! quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> did I not foretell vnto you that you should looke well what you did, for they were none other then Windemils, nor could any thinke otherwise, vnlesse hee had also Windemils in his braines. Peace <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for matters of warre are more subiect then any other thing to continuall change: how much more seeing I doe verily perswade my selfe, that the wise <hi>Freston</hi> who robbed my Studie and bookes, hath transformed these <hi>Giants</hi> into Mils, to depriue me of the glory of the victory; such is the enmity hee beares towards me. But yet in fine, all his bad arts shall but little preuaile against the goodnesse of my sword. God grant it, as he may, said <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and then helpt him to arise, and presently he mounted on <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi> who was <note n="*" place="margin">Medio spalda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. A passage through the mountaines.</note> halfe shoulderpitcht by rough encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and discoursing vpon that aduenture, they followed on the way which guided towards the passage or gate of <hi>Lapice,</hi> for there as <hi>Don Quixote</hi> auouched, it was not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173111:41"/> possible, but to finde many aduentures, because it was a through-fare much frequented, &amp; yet he affirmed that he went very much grieued because he wanted a Lance, and telling it to his Squire he said, I remember how I haue read that a certaine Spanish Knight called <hi>Diego Peres</hi> of <hi>Ʋargas,</hi> hauing broken his sword in a battaile, tore off a great branch, or stock from an Oak tree, &amp; did such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes with it that day, and battered so many Moores, as he remained with the surname of <hi>Machuca,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a stampe, and as well he, as all his progenie were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after that day called <hi>Ʋargas</hi> and <hi>Machuca,</hi> I tell thee this, because I meane to teare another branch, such, or as good at least as that, from the first Oake, we shall encounter, and I meane to atchieue such aduentures ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, as thou wilt account thy selfe fortunate, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing merited to behold them, and be a witnesse of things almost incredible. In Gods name quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doe beleeue euery word you said: but I pray you sit right in your saddle, for you ride sideling which proceeds as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the bruising you got by your fall, thou sayest true quoth <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and if I doe not complaine of the griefe, the reason is, because Knights errant vse not to complaine of any wound, although their guts did issue out thereof. If it be so (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> I know not what to say, but God knowes that I would be glad to heare you to complaine when any thing grieues you. Of my selfe I dare affirme, that I must cōplaine of the least griefe that I haue, if it be not likewise meant that the Squires of Knights errants must not complaine of any harme. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> could not refraine laughter, hearing the simplicitie of his Squire; and after shewed vnto him that he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complaine both when he pleased, &amp; as much as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, with desire, or without it, for he had neuer yet red any thing to the contrary, in the order of Knighthood. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> said vnto him, that it was dinner time, to whom he answered that he needed no repast, but if he had will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173111:41"/> to eate, he might beginne when he pleased, <hi>Sancho</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained his licence, did accommodate himselfe on his Asse backe, the best he might, taking our of his wallet some belly munition, he rode after his Master truailing and eating at once, and that with great leasure, and euer anone he lifted vp his bottle with such pleasure, as the best fed Tapster of <hi>Malaga</hi> might enuy his state, and whilst he rode multiplying of quaffes in that manner, he neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred any of the promises his Master had made him, nor did he holde the fetch of aduentures to be a labour, but rather a great recreation and ease, were they neuer so dangerous. In conclusion they past ouer that night vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certaine trees, from one of which <hi>Don Quixote</hi> tore a withered branch, which might serue him in some sort for a lance, and therfore he set thereon the yron of his owne, which he had reserued when it was broken. All that night <hi>Don Quixote</hi> slept not one winke, but thought vpon his Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> that he might conforme himself to what he had read in his bookes of aduentures, when knights passed ouer many nights without sleepe in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and fields, onely intertained by the memory of their Maistresses: but <hi>Sancho</hi> spent not his time so vainely, for hauing his stomacke well stuffed, and that not with <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corie</hi> water, he carried smoothly away the whole night in one sleepe: and if his Master had not called him vp, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sunne-beames which strucke on his visage, nor the melodie of the birds which were many, and did cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully welcome the approach of the new-day, could haue bene able to awake him, at his arriuing he gaue one assay to the bottle, which he found to bee somewhat more weake then it was the night before, whereat his heart was somewhat grieued, for he mistrusted that they tooke not a course to remedy that defect so soone as he wished: nor could <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> breake his fast, who, as we haue said meant onely to sustaine himselfe with pleasant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances. Then did they returne to their commenced
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173111:42"/> way towards the Port of <hi>Lapice,</hi> which they discouered about three of the clocke in the after-noone: heere (said <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> as soone as he kend it, may we (friend <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho)</hi> thrust our hands vp to the very elbows in that, which is called aduentures. But obserue well this Caueat which I shall giue thee, that although thou seest me in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test dangers of the world, thou must not set hand to thy sword in my defence, if thou dost not see that those which assault me be base and vile vulgar people; for in such a case thou maist assist me. Marry if they be Knights, thou maist not doe so in any wise, nor is it permitted by the Iawes of armes that thou maist helpe me, vntill thou beest likewise dubd Knight thy selfe. I doe assure you Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that herein you shal be most punctually obeyed: and therefore chiefly, in respect that I am of mine owne nature a quiet and peaceable man, and a mortall enemy of thrusting my selfe into stirres or quarrels: yet is it true that touching the defence of mine owne person, I wil not be altogether so obseruant of those lawes, seeing that both Diuine and Humane allow euery man to defend himselfe, from any one that would wrong him. I say no lesse, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but in this of ayding me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Knight, thou must set bounds to thy naturall impulses. I say that I will doe so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I will obserue this commandement as punctually, as that of keeping holy the Saboth day.</p>
               <p>Whilst thus they reasoned, there appeared in the way two Monkes of S. <hi>Benets</hi> order, mounted on two <hi>Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries;</hi> for the <hi>Mules</hi> whereon they rode were but little lesse. They wore masks with Spectacles in them, to keepe away the dust from their faces, and each of them besides bore their Vmbrilles, after them came a Coach, and foure or fiue a horse-backe accompanying it, and two Lackeyes that ranne hard by it. There came therein, as it was after knowne, a certaine <hi>Biscaine</hi> Lady, which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled towards <hi>Siuil,</hi> where her husband soicurned at the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173111:42"/> present, and was going to the <hi>Indies,</hi> with an honourable charge: the Monkes rode not with her, although they trauelled the same way. Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, when he said to his Squire, either I am deceiued or else this will proue the most famous aduenture, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath beene seene. For these two great blacke bulkes which appeare there, are questionlesse Inchanters that steale or carrie away perforce some Princesse in that Coach; and therefore I must with all my power vndoe that wrong. This will be worse then the aduenture of the Windemils, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Doe not you see Sir, that those are Fryers of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Order? and the Coach can be none other, then of some trauellers. Therefore listen to mine aduice, and see well what you doe, least that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell doe deceiue you. I haue said already to the <hi>Sancho,</hi> that thou art very ignorant in matter of aduentures. What I say is true, as now thou shalt see: and saying so, he spurd on his horse, and placed himselfe iust in the midst of the way, by which the Friars came, and when they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched so neere as he supposed they might he are him, hee said with a loude voyce: <q>Diuellish and wicked people, leaue presently those high Princesses which you vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently carie away with you in that Coach, or if you will not prepare your selues to receiue suddaine death, as a iust punishment of your bad workes.</q> The Friers held their horses, and were amazed both at the shape and words of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> To whom they answered, Sir Knight we are neither diuellish nor wicked, but religious men of S. <hi>Benets</hi> Order, that trauell about our affaires, and we know not whether, or no, there comes any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses forced in this Coach. With me saire wordes take no effect, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> For I know you very well treacherous knaues; and then without expecting their replie, he set spurs to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and laying his Launce on thē thigh, charged the first Friar with such fury and rage, that if he had not suffered himselfe willingly to fall off his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173111:43"/> Mule, he would not onely haue ouerthrowne him against his will, but likewise haue slaine, or at least wounded him very ill with the blow. The second religious man seeing how vgly his companion was vsed, made no wordes, but giuing the spurs to that Castell his <hi>Mule,</hi> did flie away through the field, as swift as the winde it selfe. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> seeing the Monke ouerthrowne, dismounted very speedily off his Asse, and ran ouer to him, and would haue ransackt his habites. In this arriued the Monkes two Lackeyes, and demaunded of him, why he thus dispoyled the Friar? <hi>Sancho</hi> replied, that it was his due by the law of armes, as lawfull spoyles gained in battell by his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> The Lackeyes which vnderstood not the jest, nor knew not what wordes of battell or spoyles meant, seeing that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was now out of the way, speaking with those that came in the Coach, set both at once vpon <hi>Sancho,</hi> and left him not a haire in his beard but they pluckt, and did so trample him vnder their feete, as they left him stretched on the ground without eyther breath or feeling: the Monke cutting off all delayes, mounted againe on horse-backe, all affrighted, hauing scarce any droppe of bloud left in his face through feare. And being once vp, he spurd after his fellow, who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him a good way off, staying to see the successe of that assault; and being vnwilling to attend the end of that strange aduenture, they did prosecute their iourney, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and crossing themselues if the Diuell did pursue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as is rehearsed, was in this season spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Lady of the Coach, to whom he said, <q>Your beauty deere Lady, may dispose from henceforth of your person, as best ye liketh; for the pride of your rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers lies now prostrated on the ground, by this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible arme. And because you may not be troubled to know your deliuerer his name, know that I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Don-Quixote de la Mancha,</hi> a Knight errant and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173111:43"/> aduenturer, and Captiue to the Peerelesse and beautiful Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso:</hi> and in reward of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which you haue receiued at my handes, I demaund nothing else, but that you returne to <hi>Toboso;</hi> and there present your selues in my name before my Lady, and recount vnto her, what I haue done to obtaine your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</q> To all these words which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, a certaine Biscaine Squire that accompanied the Coach gaue eare, who seeing that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> suffered not the Coach to passe onward, but said that it must presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe to <hi>Toboso,</hi> he drew neere to him, and laying hold on his Launce, he said in his bad Spanish and worse Basquish; get thee away Knight in an ill houre, by the God that created me, if thou leaue not the Coach, I will kill thee, as sure as I am a <hi>Biscaine. Don-Quixote</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing him, did answere with great staidnesse, if thou werest a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cauallero</hi> in Spanish is taken as well for a Gentleman, as for a Knight.</note> Knight as thou art not, I would by this haue punished thy folly and presumption, caytife creature. The Biscaine replied with great furie, Not I a Gentleman? I sweare God thou liest as well as I am a Christian. If thou cast away thy Launce, and draw thy sword, <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> thou shalt see the water as soone as thou shalt carie away the Cat: A <hi>Biscaine</hi> by land, and a Gentleman by Sea, a Gentleman in despite of the Diuell, and thou liest if other things thou sayest. Straight thou shalt see that, said <hi>Agrages;</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and throwing his Launce to the ground, he out with his sword, and tooke his Bucklet, and set on the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> with resolution to kill him. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> seeing him approach in that manner, although he desired to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light off his <hi>Mule,</hi> which was not to be trusted, being one of those naughty ones which are wont to be hired, yet had he no leisure to do any other thing then to draw out his sword: but it befell him happily to be neere to the Coach, out of which he snatched a cushion that serued him for a shield, and presently the one made vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like mortall enemies. Those that were present labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:173111:44"/> all that they might, but in vaine to compound the matter betweene them; for the <hi>Biscaine</hi> swore in his bad language, that if they hindred him from ending the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, he would put his Lady, and all the rest that dared to disturbe him to the sword.</p>
               <p>The Ladie astonished and fearefull of that which shee beheld, commaunded the Coach-man to goe a little out of the way, and sate aloofe, beholding the rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. In the progresse whereof the <hi>Biscaine</hi> gaue <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ouer the Target a mighty blow on one of the shoulders, where if it had not found resistance in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it would doubtlesly haue cleft him downe to the girdle. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> feeling the waight of that vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable blow, cried with a loude voice, saying, <q>O <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> Lady of my soule, the flowre of all beauty, succour this thy Knight, who to set forth thy worth, finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this dangerous trance.</q> The saying of these words, the griping fast of his sword, the couering of himselfe wel with his Buckler, and the assayling of the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> was done all in one instant, resoluing to venter all the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the battell on that one only blow. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> who perceiued him come in that manner, perceiued by his doughtinesse his intention, and resolued to doe the like; and therefore expected him very well couered with his Cushion, not being able to manage his <hi>Mule</hi> as hee wished from one part to another, who was not able to go a steppe, it was so wearied, as a beast neuer before vsed to the like toyes. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as wee haue said, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the weary <hi>Biscaine,</hi> with his sword lifted aloft, with a full resolution to part him in two, and all the beholders stood with great feare suspended, to see the successe of those monstrous blowes wherwithall they threatned one another. And the Lady of the Coach with her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women made a thousand vowes, and offerings to all the deuoute places of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the end that God might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the Squire, and themselues out of that great danger wherein they were.</p>

True it is, that the second writer of this worke would not beleeue that so curious a History was drownd in the jawes obliuion, or that the wits of the <hi>Mancha</hi> were so little curious as not to reserue among their treasuries or records, some papers treating of this famous Knight: and therefore encouraged by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, he did not dispaire to finde the end of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant History; which heauen being propicious to him he got at last after the manner that shall be recounted in the second Part.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee left the valorous <hi>Biscaine,</hi> and the samous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in the first part, with their swords lifted vp and naked in terms to discharge one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two furious Cleeuers, and such, as if they had allighted rightly, would cut and diuide them both from the top to the toe, and open them like a <hi>Pomgranat.</hi> And that in so doubtfull a taking the delightfull History stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and remained dismembred, the authour thereof lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs no notice where we might finde the rest of the narration. This grieued me not a little, but wholly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the pleasure I tooke in reading the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173111:46"/> into disgust, thinking how small commodity was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to finde out so much as in mine opinion wanted of this so delectable a tale. It seemed vnto me almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and contrary to all good order, that so good a Knight should want some wise man, that would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his wonderfull prowesses and feats of Chiualrie. A thing that none of those Knights errant euer wanted, of whom people speake; for each of them had one or two wise men of purpose, that did not only write their actes, but also depainted their very least thoughts and toyes, were they neuer so hidden. And surely so good a Knight could not be so vnfortunate as to want that, wherewith <hi>Platyr</hi> and others his like abounded; and therfore could not induce my selfe to beleeue, that so gallant a Historie might remaine maimed and lame, and did rather cast the fault vpon the malice of the time, who is a consumer and deuourer of all things, which had eyther hidden or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed it. Me thought on the other side, seeing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his bookes were found some moderne works, such as the <hi>Vndeceiuing of Iealousie,</hi> and <hi>The nymphs and shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of Henares.</hi> That also his owne History must haue bin new; &amp; if that it were not written, yet was the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him fresh among the dwellers of his owne village, and the other villages adioyning. This imagination held me suspended and desirous to learne really and truely all the life and miracles of our famous Spaniard <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote of the Mancha,</hi> the light and mirrour of all <hi>Manchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Chiualrie; being the first who in this our age and time so full of calamities did vndergo the trauels and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of armes errant; and vndid wrongs, succourd wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes protected damzels that rode vp and downe with their whips and Palfrayes, and with all their virginity on their backes from hill to hill, and dale to dale; for if it hapned not that some lewd miscreant, or some Clowne with a hatchet and long haire, or some monstrous Giant did force them, damzels there were in times past that at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173111:46"/> the end of fourescore yeares olde, all which time they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer slept one day vnder a roose, went as intire and pure maydens to their graues, as the very mother that bore them. Therefore I say, that as well for this as for many other good respects, our gallant <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is worthy of continuall and memorable prayses; nor can the like be iustly denied to my selfe, for the labour and diligence which I vsed to finde out the end of this gratefull Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; although I know very well, that if Heauen, Chance, and Fortune had not assisted me, the world had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the delight and pastime, that he may take for almost two houres together, who shall with attention reade it. The manner therefore of finding it was this:</p>
               <p>Being one day walking in the Exchange of <hi>Toledo</hi> a certain boy by chance would haue sold certain old quires &amp; scroules of bookes to a Squire that walked vp &amp; down in that place, and I being addicted to reade such scroules, though I found them torne in the streets, borne away by this my naturall inclination, tooke one of the quiers in my hand, and perceiued it to be written in Arabicall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and seeing that although I knew the letters, yet could I not read the substance, I looked about to view whether I might perceiue any more translated Spaniard, thereabouts that could read them: nor was it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to finde there such an interpreter, for if I searched one of an other better and more ancient <note n="*" place="margin">To wit, a Iew.</note> language, that place might easily affoord him. In fine my good fortune presented one to me, to whom telling my desire, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the booke in his hand, he opened it, and hauing read a little therein, began to laugh. I demaunded of him why he laughed? and he answered, at that marginall note which the booke had. I bad him to expound it to me, and with that tooke him a little aside: and he continuing still his laughter said, there is written here on this margin these words. <hi>This Dulcinea of Toboso so many times spoken of in this historie, had the best hand for powdring of Porkes, of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173111:47"/> any woman in all the Mancha.</hi> When I heard it make mention of <hi>Dulcinea of To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> I rested amazed and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and imagined forthwith that those quiers contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Historie of Don Quixote,</hi> with this conceit I hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to read the beginning which he did, &amp; translating the <hi>Arabicall</hi> into <hi>Spanish</hi> in a trice, he said that it began thus, <hi>The Historie of Don Quixote of the Mancha, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Cyde Hamete Benengeli, an Arabicall Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher.</hi> Much discretion was requisite to dissemble the content of mind I conceiued, when I heard the title of the booke, and preuenting the Squire, I bought all the boyes scroles and papers for halfe a Riall, and were he of discretion, or knew my desire, he might haue promised himselfe easily, and also borne away with him more then sixe Reals for his Merchandize. I departed after with the Moore, to the Cloyster of the great Church, and I reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him to turne me all the <hi>Arabicall</hi> sheetes that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> into Spanish, without adding or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away any thing from them, and I would pay him what he listed for his paines: he demaunded fifty pounds of Reasons and three bushels of Wheate, and promised to translate them speedily, well, and faithfully. But I, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the matter more, least I should lofe such an vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and welcome treasure, brought him to my house, where he translated all the worke in lesse then a moneth and a halfe, euen in the manner that it is here recounted.</p>
               <p>There was painted in the first Quier very naturally the battell betwixt <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the <hi>Biscaine;</hi> euen in the same manner that the History relateth it, with their swords listed aloft, the one couered with his Buckler, the other with the Cushion: and the <hi>Biscaines Mule</hi> was deliuered so naturally, as a man might perceiue it was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; although he stood farther off then the shot of a Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow: the <hi>Biscaine</hi> had a title written vnder his feete that said <hi>Don Sancho de Azpetia,</hi> for so belike he was called: and at <hi>Rozinante</hi> his feete there was another that said,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173111:47"/>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote. Rozinante</hi> was maruellous well pourtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so long and lanke, so lanke and leane, so like one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with an incurable consumption, as he did shew very cleerely with what consideration and propriety hee had giuen vnto him the name <hi>Rozinante.</hi> By him stood <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> holding his Asse by the halter; at whose feete was another scroule, saying, <hi>Sancho Cancas:</hi> and I thinke the reason thereof was, that as his picture shewed, he had a great belly, a short stature, and thick legges. And therfore I iudge he was called * <hi>Panca</hi> or <hi>Canca,</hi> for both these names are written of him indifferently in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There were other little things in it worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but all of them are of no great importance, nor any thing necessary for the true relation of the Historie, for none is ill if it be true. And if any obiection be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth of this, it can be none other then that the author was a Moore, and it is a knowne propriety of that nation to be lying: yet in respect that they hate vs so mortally, it is to be coniectured that in this History there is rather want and concealment of our Knights worthy actes, then any superfluity; which I imagine the rather, because I finde in the progresse thereof many times, that when he might and ought to haue aduanced his penne in our Knights prayses, he does as it were of purpose passe them ouer in silence. Which was very ill done, seeing that Historiographers ought and should be very precise, true, and vnpassionate, and that neither profite, or feare, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor or affection should make them to treade awry from the truth, whose mother is History, the Emulatresse of Time, the depository of actions, the witnesse of things past, and aduertiser of things to come. In this Historie I know a man may finde all that he can desire in the most pleasing maner; and if they want any thing to be desired, I am of opinion that it is through the fault of that vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious knaue that translated it, rather then through any defect in the subiect. Finally the second part thereof (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:173111:48"/> to the translation) began in this manner:</p>
               <p>The trenchant swords of the two valorous and inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged combattants being listed a loft, it seemed that they threatned Heauen, the earth, and the depths. Such was their hardines and courage: and the first that discharged his blow was the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> which fell with such force and fury, as if the sword had not turned a little in the way, that onely blow were sufficient to set an end to the rigorous contention, and all other the aduentures of our Knight. But his good <hi>Fortune</hi> which rescrued him for greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, did wrest his aduersaries sword awry in such sort, as though he stroke him on the left shoulder, yet did it no more harme, then disarme all that side, carying away with it a great part of his Beauer, with the halfe of his eare; all which fell to the ground with a dreadfull ruine, leauing him in very ill case for a good time. Good God! who is he that can well describe at this present the sury that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the heart of our <hi>Manchegan,</hi> seeing himselfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that manner? Let vs say no more, but that it was such, that stretching himselfe againe in the stirrops, and griping his sword fast in both his handes, he discharged such a terrible blow on the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> hitting him right vpon the Cushion, &amp; by it on the head, that the strength and thickenesse thereof so little auailed him, that as if a whole mountaine had falne vpon him, the blood gushed out of his mouth, nose, and cares, all at once, and he totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so on his Mule, that euery steppe he tooke he was ready to fall off, as he would indeede, if he had not taken him by the necke: yet neuerthelesse he lost the stirrops, and loosing his gripe of the Mule, it being likewise frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that terrible blow, ranne away as fast as it could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fields, and within two or three winches, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him to the ground. All which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood beholding with great quietnesse, and as soone as he saw him fall he leapt off his horse, and ranne ouer to him very speedily, and setting the point of his sword on his eyes, he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173111:48"/> bad him yeeld himselfe or else he would cut off his head. The <hi>Biscaine</hi> was so amazed as hee could not speake a word, and it had succeeded very ill with him, considering <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> fury, if the Ladies of the Coach, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then had beheld the conflict with great anguish, had not come where he was, and earnestly besought him to doe them the fauour to pardon their Squires life. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered with a great loftinesse and grauity; <q>Truely faire Ladies I am well appaid to graunt your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but it must be with this agreement and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this Knight shall promise me to goe to <hi>Toboso,</hi> and present himselfe in my name to the Peerelesse La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> to the end she may dispose of him as shee pleaseth.</q> The timerous and comfortlesse Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was, promised that her Squire should accomplish all that he pleased to commaund. Why then quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> trusting to your promise, I'le do him no more harme, although he hath well deserued it at my handes.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173111:49"/>
                  <hi>Rozinante;</hi> he came to holde him the stirrop, and cast himselfe on his knees before him ere he got vp, and taking him by the hand, he kist it, saying, I desire that it will please you good my Lorde <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon me the gouernement of that Island which in this terrible battell you haue wonne; for though it were neuer so great, yet doe I finde my selfe able enough to gouerne it, as well as any other whatsoeuer that euer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned Island in this world. To this demand <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, thou must note friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and others of this kind are not aduentures of Islands but of thwartings and high wayes, wherein nothing else is gained but a broken pate, or the losse of an eare. Haue patience a while, for aduentures will be offered, whereby thou shalt not only be made a gouernour, but also a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man▪ <hi>Sancho</hi> rendred him many thankes, and kissing his hand againe, and the skirt of his Habergeon, hee did helpe him to get vp on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and he leapt on his Asse, and followed his Lord: who with a swift pace, without taking leaue, or speaking to those of the Coach, he entred into a wood that was hard at hand. <hi>Sancho</hi> followed him as fast as his beast could trotte, but <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> went off so swiftly, as he perceiuing he was like to be left behinde, was forced to call aloude to his Master that he would stay for him. Which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did by checking <hi>Rozinante</hi> with the bridle, vntill his wearied Squire did arriue, who as soone as he came, said vnto him: Me thinkes (Sir) that it will not be amisse to retire our selues to some Church; for according as that man is ill dight with whom you fought, I certainly perswade my selfe that they will giue notice of the fact to the <hi>holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,</hi> and they will seeke to apprehend vs; which if they doe, in good faith before we can get out of their clawes, I feare me we shall sweate for it. Peace, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> where hast thou euer read or seene that Knight errant that hath been brought before the Iudge,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173111:49"/> though hee committed neuer so many homicides and slaughters. I know nothing of Omicilles, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> nor haue I cared in my life for any, but well I wote that it concernes the <hi>holy brotherhood</hi> to deale with such as fight in the fields, &amp; in that other I wil not intermedle. Then be not afraid friēd, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I wil deliuer thee out of the hands of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> how much more out of those of the <hi>brotherhood.</hi> But tell me in very good earnest whether thou didst euer see a more valorous Knight then I am, throughout the face of the earth? Didst thou euer reade in Histories of any other that hath, or euer had more courage in assayling, more breath in perseuering, more dexterity in offending, or more arte in ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then I? The truth is, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I haue neuer read any History, for I can neither reade nor write, but that which I dare wager is, that I neuer in my life serued a bolder Master then you are, and I pray God that we pay not for this boldnes, there where I haue said. That which I request you is, that you will cure your selfe, for you loose much bloud by that eare; and here I haue linte and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Vnguentum Album</hi> in my Wallet. All this night be excused, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if I had remembred to make a Violl full of the <hi>Balsamum</hi> of <hi>Fierebras,</hi> for with one drop of it we might spare both time, and want well al those other medicines. What Viall, and what <hi>Balsamum</hi> is that, said <hi>Sancho Panca?</hi> It is, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> a <hi>Balsamum</hi> whereof I haue the receit in memory, which one possessing he needes not feare death, nor ought he to thinke that he may be killed by any wound: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after I haue made it, and giuen it vnto thee, thou hast nothing else to doe, but when thou shalt see that in any battell I be cleuen in twaine (as many times it happens) thou shalt take faire and softly that part of my body that is falne to the ground, and put it vp again with great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty on the part that rests in the saddle, before the blood congeale, hauing euermore great care that thou place it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173111:50"/> iust and equally; then presently after thou shalt giue me two draughts of that <hi>Balsamum,</hi> which I haue said, thou shalt see me streight become sounder then an apple. If that be true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I doe presently here renounce the gouernement of the Island you promised, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nothing else in recompence of my seruices of you, but onely the receit of this precious liquor; for I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that an ounce thereof will be worth two Reals in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, and when I haue it I should neede nothing else to gaine my liuing easily and honestly. But let me know, is it costly in making? With lesse then three Reals, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> a man may make three gallons of it. But I meane to teach thee greater secrets then this, and do thee greater fauours also. And now let me cure my selfe, for mine eare grieues me more then I would wish. <hi>Sancho</hi> then tooke out of his wallet his linte and oyntment to cure his Master. But when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar of his helmet was broken, he was ready to run mad; and setting his hand to his sword, and lifting vp his eyes to heauen, he said, I vow to the creator of all things, and to the foure Gospels where they are largest written, to leade such another life as the great <hi>Marquesse of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> did, when he swore to reuenge the death of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Valdouinos,</hi> which was, not to eate on Table-cloth, nor sport with his wife, and other things, which although I doe not now remember I giue them heere for expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, vntil I take complete reuenge on him that hath done me this outrage. <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing this, said, you must note Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that if the Knight hath accomplished that which you ordained, to goe and present himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> then hath he fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his debt, and deserues no new punishment, except he cōmit a new fault. Thou hast spoken wel &amp; hit the marke right, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therfore I disanull the oath in that of taking any new reuenge on him: but I make it, and confirme it againe, that I wil leade the life I haue said,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173111:50"/> vntill I take another helmet like, or as good as this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force from some Knight. And do not thinke <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I make this resolution lightly, or as they say, with the smoake of strawes; for I haue an authour whom I may very well imitate herein, for the very like in euery respect past about <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, which cost <hi>Sacriphante</hi> so deerly. I would haue you resigne those kinde of oathes to the Diuel, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for they wil hurt your health, and preiudice your conscience. If not, tell me now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feech you, if we shal not these many daies encounter with any that weares a helmet, what shall we doe? Will you accomplish the oath, in despite of all the inconueniences and discommodities that ensue thereof? to wit, to sleepe in your clothes: not to slēepe in any dwelling, &amp; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other penitencies, which the oath of the madde olde man, the <hi>Marquesse of Mantua</hi> contained, which you meane to ratifie now? Doe not you consider that armed men trauell not in any of these wayes, but Carriers and Waggoners, who not onely carie no helmets, but also for the most part neuer heard speake of them in their liues. Thou dost deceiue thy selfe saying so, replied <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> for we shall not haunt these wayes two houres, before we shall see more armed Knights then were at the siege of <hi>Albraca,</hi> to conquer <hi>Angelica the faire.</hi> Well then, let it be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I pray God it befall vs well; whom I deuoutly beseech that the time may arriue of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that Island which costs me so deere, and after let me die presently and I care not. I haue already said to thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth his Lord, that thou shouldst not trouble thy selfe in any wife about this affaire; for when an Island were wanting, we haue then the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke</hi> or that of <hi>Sobradisa</hi> which will come as fit for thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as a ring to thy finger, and principally thou art to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, because they are on the continent. But omitting this till his owne time, see whether thou hast any thing in thy wallet, and let vs eate it, that afterward we may goe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173111:51"/> search out some Castle, wherin we may lodge this night, and make the <hi>Balsamum</hi> which I haue tolde thee. For I vow to God that this eare grieues me maruellously. I haue here an Onion, replied the Squire, a peece of Cheese and a few crustes of bread, but such grosse meates are not befitting so noble a Knight as you are. How ill dost thou vnderstand it, answered <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> I let thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Sancho,</hi> that it is an honour for Knights errant not to eate once in a moneths space; and if by chaunce they should eate, to eate onely of that which is next at hand. And this thou mightest certainely conceiue, hadst thou read so many bookes as I haue done For though I past ouer many, yet did I neuer finde recorded in any that Knights errant did euer eate, but by meere chance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, or in some costly banquets that were made for them, and all the other daies they past ouer with hearbs and rootes: and though it is to be vnderstood that they could not liue without meate, and supplying the other needes of nature, because they were in effect men as wee are: it is likewise to bee vnderstood that spending the greater part of their liues in Forrests and desarts, and that too without a Cook, that their most ordinary meats were but course and rusticall, such as thou dost now offer vnto me. So that friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> let not that trouble thee which is my pleasure, nor goe not thou about to make a new world, or to hoist Chiualrie errant off of her hinges. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> for by reason I can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reade nor write, as I haue said once before, I haue not falne rightly in the rules and Iawes of Knighthood; and from henceforth my wallet shall be well furnished with all kindes of drie fruits for you, because you are a Knight: and for my selfe seeing I am none, I will prouide fowles and other things, that are of more substance. I say not <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that it is a forcible law to Knights errant, not to eate any other things then such fruits, but that their most ordinary sustenance could be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173111:51"/> none other then those, and some hearbes they found vp and downe the fields, which they knew very well, and so doe I also. It is a vertue, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to know those hearbes; for as I imagine that knowledge will some day stand vs in stead: and saying so, he tooke out the prouision he had, which they both cate together with good confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. But being desirous to search out a place where they might lodge that night, they did much shorten their poore dinner, and mounting anone a horse-backe, they made as much hast as they could, to finde out some dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, before the night did fall, but the Sunne and their hopes did faile them, at once they being neare the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins of certaine Goat-heards; and therefore they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take vp their lodging there for that night; for though <hi>Sanchoes</hi> griefe was great to he out of a village, yet <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> ioy exceeded it farre, considering hee must sleepe vnder open heauen, because he made account as oft as this befell him, that he did a worthy acte, which did facilitate and ratifie the practise of his Chiualry.</p>

So that, (good Sir) I would haue you conuert these honours that you would bestow vpon me in respect that I am an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Chiualry, as I am being your Squire, into things more essentiall and profitable for me then these; and though I remaine as thankefull for them, as if they were

               <p>The Goatherds did not vnderstand that <hi>Gibbrish</hi> of <hi>Squires</hi> and <hi>Knights errant,</hi> and therefore did nothing else but eate, and hold their peace, and looke on their guests, that tossed in with their fish whole slics, with good grace and stomacks. The course of flesh being ended, they serued in on the rugges a great quantity of sheld Akorns, and halfe a cheese harder then if it were made of rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casting. The horne stood not the while idle, for it went round about so often now full, now empty much like a conduit <note n="*" place="margin">Arcaduzed Noria. p. 76.</note> of Noria. And in a trice it emptied one of the two wine bags that lay there in the publike view. After that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had satisfied his appetite well, he tooke vp a fish full of Acornes, and beholding them carnestly, he began to discourse in this manner. <q>Happy time, and fortunate ages were those, whereon our ancestors bestowed the title of Goulden, not because Gould (so much prized in this our yron age) was gotten in that happy time, without any labours, but because those which liued in that time, knew not these two words <hi>Thine</hi> &amp; <hi>Mine,</hi> in that holy age all things were in common: No man needed for his ordinarie suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to doe ought else then lift vp his hand, and take it from the strong Oke, which did liberally inuite them, gather his sweete and sauory fruite. The cleare foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and running riuers did offer them these sauorie and transparent waters in magnificent abundance. In the clifts of rocks and hollow trees did the carefull and disercete <hi>bees</hi> erect their commonwealth, offering to euery hand without interest, the fertile croppe of their sweetest trauailes. The loftie Corke tree did dismisse of thēselues without any other art then that of their natiue liberalitie, their broad and light rindes. Wherewithall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173111:53"/> horses were at first couered, being sustained by rusticall stakes, to none other end, but for to keepe backe the inclemencies of the Ayre. All then was peace, all ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all concord: as yet the plowshade presumed not with rude encounter to open and search the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate bowels of our first mother; for she without compulsion offered vp through all the parts of her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and spacious bosome all that which might satisfie, sustaine, and delight those children which it then had: yea it was then that the simple and beautifull young Sheepheardesses went from valley to valley, and hill to hill, with their haires sometimes plaited, sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheueld, without other apparrell then that which was requisite to couer comelily that which modesty wils and euer would haue concealed. Then were of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the attires and ornaments which are now vsed, by those that esteem the purple of Tyre and the so-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-waies-martyrized Silke so much: but onely certaine greene leaues of <hi>Burdocks</hi> and <hi>Iuie</hi> intertexed and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen together, wherewithall perhaps they went as gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously and comely deckt, as now our Court-dames with all the rare and out-landish inuentions that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and curiosity hath found out. Then, were the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous conceits of the minde, simply and sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and imbellished in the very forme and manner that she had conceiued them, without any artificiall contexture of wordes to indeere them; fraude, deceit, or mallice had not then medled themselues with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and truth: Iustice was in her proper termes, fauor daring not to trouble or confound her, or the respect of profite which do now prosecute, blemish, and disturbe her so much. The law of corruption or taking bribes had not yet possest the vnderstanding of the Iudge; for then was neither Iudge nor person to be iudged. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and honesty wandred then I say where they listed, alone signiorizing secure, that no stranger liberty or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciuious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173111:53"/> intent could preiudice it, or their owne natiue desire or will any way endamage it. But now in these our detestable times no damzel is safe, although she be hid and shut vp in another new Labyrinth, like that of <hi>Creete;</hi> for euen there it selfe the amorous plague would enter, eyther by some cranie, or by the ayre, or by the continuall vrgings of cursed care, to infect her. For whose protection and security was last instituted. By successe of times the order of Knighthood; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend damzels, protect widows, and assist Orphans and distressed wights. Of this order am I, friends Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, whom I doe heartily thanke for the good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement which you giue vnto me and my Squire: for although that euery one liuing is obliged by the law of nature to fauour Knights errant; yet notwithstanding, knowing that you knew not this obligation, and yet did receiue and make much of me, it stands with all reason that I doe render you thankes with all my heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Knight made this long Oration (which might haue beene well excused) because the Acornes that were giuen vnto him, called to his minde the golden world: and therefore the humour tooke him to make the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards that vnprofitable discourse, who heard him all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and suspended with very great attention all the while. <hi>Sancho</hi> likewise held his peace, eating Acornes, and in the meane while visited very often the second wine bagge, which because it might be fresh, lay hanged vpon a Corke tree. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had spent more time in his speech then in his supper; at the end whereof one of the Goat-heards said, to the end that you may more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly know, Sir Knight errant, that we doe intertaine you with prompt and ready will, we will likewise make you some pastime, by hearing one of our companions sing, who is a Heard of good vnderstanding, and very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous withall; and can besides reade and write, and playes so well on a Rebecke, that there is nothing to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173111:54"/> desired. Scarce had the Goat-heard ended his speech, when the sound of the Rebecke touched his eare, and within a while after he arriued that played on it, being a youth of some twenty years olde, and one of a very good grace and countenance. His fellowes demaunded if he had supped, and answering that he had; he which did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the curtesie, said; then <hi>Anthony</hi> thou mayst doe vs a pleasure by singing a little, that this Gentleman our guest may see, that we enioy amidst these groues and woods, those that know what musicke is: we haue tolde him already thy good qualities, and therefore we desire that thou shew them, to verifie our wordes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I desire thee by thy life, that thou wilt sit and sing the Dittie which thy vncle the Prebendary made of thy loue, and was so wel liked of in our village. I am content, quoth the youth, and without further intreaty, sitting downe on the truncke of a lopped Oake, hee turned his Rebecke, and after a while began with a singular good grace to sing in this manner.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout this time arriued another youth, one of those that brought them prouision from the Village, who said; Companions, doe not you know what passeth in the Village? How can we know it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? saies another of them. Then wit, quoth the youth, that the famous Sheepheard, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Ghrisostome</hi> died this morning, and they murmure that he died for loue of that diuellish lasse <hi>Marcela, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the rich his daughter, she that goes vp and downe these plaines and hils among vs in the habite of a <hi>Pastora.</hi> Dost thou meane <hi>Marcela,</hi> quoth one of them? Euen her, I say, answered the other; and the jest is, that he hath commaunded in his Testament, that he be buried in the fields as if he were a Moore; and that it be at the foote of the Rocke, where the fountaine stands of the Corke tree. For that according to fame, and as they say, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe affirmed, was the place wherein he viewed her first. And he hath likewise commaunded such other things to be done, as the auncienter sort of the Village doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor thinke fit to be performed; for they seeme to be ceremonies of the Gentiles. To all which obiections his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173111:56"/> great friend <hi>Ambrosio</hi> the Student, who likewise appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled himselfe like a Sheepheard, at once with him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, that all shall be accomplished, without omission of any thing, as <hi>Ghrisostome</hi> hath ordayned, and all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage is in an vprore about this affaire, and yet it is said that what <hi>Ambrosio</hi> and all the other Sheepheards his friends doe pretend shall in fine be done: and to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they will come to the place I haue named, to burie him with great pompe. And as I suppose it will be a thing worthy the seeing: at leastwise I will not omit to go and behold it, although I were sure that I could not return the same day to the Village. We will all doe the same, quoth the Goat-heards, and will draw lots who shall tarry here to keepe all our Heards. Thou sayest well <hi>Peter,</hi> quoth one of them, although that labour may be excused; for I meane to stay behinde for you all; which you must not attribute to any vertue, or little curiosity in me, but rather to the forke that prickt my foot the other day, and makes me vnable to trauell from hence. We doe thanke thee notwithstanding, quoth <hi>Peter,</hi> for thy good will. And <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who heard all their discourse, intreated <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to tell him who that dead man was, and what the Sheepheardesse of whom they spoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> made answer, that what he knew of the affaire was, that the dead person was a rich Gentleman of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Village, seated among those mountaines, who had studied many yeares in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and after returned home to his house, with the opinion to be a very wise and learned man: but principally it was reported of him, that he was skilfull in Astronomie, and all that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed aboue in heauen, in the Sunne and the Moone; for he would tell vs most punctually the clips of the Sunne and the Moone. Friend, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the darkening of these two greater <hi>Luminaries</hi> is called an <hi>Eclipse,</hi> and not a <hi>Clipse:</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> stopping not at those trisles, did prosecute his History, saying, he did also prognosticate
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173111:56"/> when the yeare would be abundant or <hi>Estil.</hi> Thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest say <hi>Sterril,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote Sterril</hi> or <hi>Estil,</hi> said <hi>Peter,</hi> all is one for my purpose: &amp; I say, that by his words, his father and his other friends, that gaue credite to him became very rich. For they did all that hee counselled them, who would say vnto them: sow Barley this yeare and no Wheate. In this you may sow Pease and no Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. The next yeare will be good for Oyle. The three ensuing you shall not gather a drop. That science is called <hi>Astrologie,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I know not how it is called, replied <hi>Peter;</hi> but I know well, he knew all this and much more. Finally, a few moneths after he came from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> he appeared one day apparrelled like a Sheepheard with his flocke, and leather coat; hauing laid aside the long habites that hee wore, being a scholler, and ioyntly with him came also a great friend of his, and fellow Student called <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> apparrelled like a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. I did almost forget to tell how <hi>Grisostome</hi> the dead man was a great maker of verses; insomuch that he made the Carrols of Christmas day at night, and the playes for <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, which the youthes of our Village did represent, and all of them affirmed, that they were most excellent. When those of the Village saw the two schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers so suddenly clad like Sheepheards, they were amazed and could not ghesse the cause that moued them to make so wonderfull a change. And about this time <hi>Grisostomes</hi> father died, and he remained possessed of a great deale of goods, as well moueable as immoueable; and no little quantity of cattell great and smal; and also a great summe of money; of all which the young man remained a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord. And truely he deserued it all; for hee was a good fellow, and a charitable and a friend of good folke, and he had a face like a blessing. It came at last to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the cause of changing his habite was none other, then for to goe vp and downe through these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts after the <hi>Pastora Marcela,</hi> whom our Heard named
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173111:57"/> before, of whom the poore dead <hi>Grisostome</hi> was become enamoured. And I will tell you now, because it is fit you should know it, what this wanton lasse is, perhaps, and I think without perhaps you haue not heard the like thing in all the dayes of your life, although you had liued more yeares then <hi>Sarna.</hi> Say <hi>Sarra,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> being not able to heare him any longer to change one word for another. The <hi>Sarna</hi> or scabbe, quoth <hi>Peter,</hi> liues long enough too. And if you go this Sir, interrupting my tale at euery pace, we shall not be able to end it in a yeare. Pardon me friend, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I speake to thee by reason there was such difference betweene <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Sarra.</hi> But thou didst answere well; for the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> or scabbe liues longer then <hi>Sarra.</hi> And therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute thy Historie: for I will not interrupt thee any more. I say then deere Sir of my soule, quoth the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that there was in our Village a farmer that was yet richer then <hi>Grisostomes</hi> father, who was called <hi>William,</hi> to whom fortune gaue in the end of his great riches a daughter called <hi>Marcela,</hi> of whose birth her mother di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who was the best woman that dwelled in all this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit. Me thinkes I doe now see her quicke before me, with that face, which had on the one side the Sunne, and on the other the Moone, and aboue all she was a thriftie houswife, and a great friend to the poore. For which I beleeue that her soule is this very very houre enioying of the Gods in the other world. For griefe of the losse of so good a wife her husband <hi>William</hi> likewise died, leauing his daughter <hi>Marcela</hi> young and rich in the custody of his Vncle, who was a Priest, and Curate of our Village. The childe grew with such beauty, as it made vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that of her mother, which was very great. And yet notwithstanding they iudged that the daughters would surpasse hers, as indeed it did: for when shee arriued to the age of fourteene or fifteene yeares olde, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, that did not blesse God for making her so faire:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173111:57"/> and most men remained enamoured and cast-away for her loue. Her Vncle kept her with very great care and closenesse: and yet neuerthelesse the fame of her great beautie did spread it selfe in such sort, that as well for it as for her great riches, her Vncle was not onely requested by those of our Village, but also was prayed, sollicited, and importuned by all those that dwelled many-leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and that by the very best of them, to giue her to them in marriage. But he (who is a good Christian eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inch of him) although he desired to marrie her present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as soone as she was of age, yet would hee not doe it without her good will; without euer respecting the gaine and profite he might make by the possession of her goods, whilst he desired her marriage. And in good sooth this was spoken of, to the good Priest his commendation, in more then one meeting of the people of our Village. For I would haue you to wit, Sir errant, that in these little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages they talke of all things, and make account, as I doe, that the Priest must haue beene too good, who could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige his Parishioners to speake so well of him, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Villages: thou hast reason, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore follow on, for the History is very pleasant; and thou good <hi>Peter</hi> dost recount it with a very good grace. I pray God, said <hi>Peter,</hi> that I neuer want our Heards; for it is that which makes to the purpose. And in the rest you shall vnderstand that although her Vncle propounded and told to his Niese the quality of euery woer of the many that desired her for wife, and intreated her to marrie and chuse at her pleasure; yet would shee neuer answer other, but that she would not marry as then, and that in respect of her ouer greene years, she did not finde her selfe able enough yet to beare the burden of marriage. With these iust excuses which shee seemed to giue, her Vncle left of importuning of her, and did expect vntill she were farther entred into yeares; and that shee might know how to chuse one that might like her. For
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173111:58"/> he was wont to say, and that very wel, <hi>That Parents were not to place or bestow their children where they bore no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi> But see here when wee least imagined it, the coy <hi>Marcela</hi> appeared one morning to become a <hi>Pastora:</hi> and neyther her Vncle nor all those of the Village which disswaded her from it could worke any effect, but she would needes goe to the fieldes, and keepe her owne sheepe with the other young lasses of the towne. And she comming thus in publike, when her beauty was seene without hinderance, I cannot possibly tell vnto you, how many rich youthes as well Gentlemen as Farmers haue taken on the array of <hi>Grisostome,</hi> and follow woing of her vp and downe those fields. One of which, as is said already, was our dead man, of whom it is said, that leauing to loue her, he had at last made her his Idoll. Nor is it to be thought that because <hi>Marcela</hi> set her selfe in that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For although she did not slie or shunne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and conuersation of Sheepheards, and doth vse them courteously &amp; friendlily, whensoeuer anyone of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to discouer their intention be it euer so iust and holy, as is that of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> she casts them away from her, as with a sling. And with this manner of proceeding shee does more harme in this countrey, then if the plague had entred into it by her meanes: for her affability and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth draw to it the hearts of those which do serue and loue her. But her disdaine and resolution doe conduct them to termes of desperation; and so they know not what to say vnto her, but to call her with a loude voyce cruell &amp; vngratefull, with other titles like vnto this, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173111:58"/> doe cleerely manifest the nature of her condition. And Sir, if you staid here but a few daies, you should heare these mountaines resound with the lamentations of those wretches that follow her. There is a certaine place not farre off, wherein are about two douzens of Beech trees, and there is not any one of them in whose rinde is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen <hi>Marcelas</hi> name, and ouer some names grauen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a crowne in the same tree, as if her louer would plainly deuote that <hi>Marcela</hi> beares it away, and deserues the garland of all humane beauty. Heere sighes one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; there another complaines, in another place are heard amorous ditties, heere in another dolefull and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring laments. Some one there is that passeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And some other there is, who without giuing wade or truce to his sighes, doth amidst the feruor of the most sastidious heate of the Summer, stretcht vpon the burning sand, breathe his pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull complaints to heauen: and of this, and of him, and of those, and these, the beautifull <hi>Marcela</hi> doth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and quietly triumph: all we that know her, doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait to see wherein this her loftinesse will finish, or who shall be so happy as to gaine dominion ouer so terrible a condition; and enioy so Peerelesse a beauty. And because all that I haue recounted is so notorious a truth, it makes me more easily beleeue that our companion hath tolde, that is said of the occasion of <hi>Grisostomes</hi> death: and therefore I doe counsell you Sir, that you doe not omit to be present to morrow at his buriall, which will be worthy the seeing, for <hi>Grisostome</hi> hath many friends, &amp; the place wherein he commaunded himselfe to bee buried is not halfe a league from hence. I doe meane to be there, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and doe render thee many thankes for the delight thou hast giuen me, by the relation of so pleasant
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173111:59"/> a History. O quoth the Goat-heard, I doe not yet know the halfe of the aduentures succeeded to <hi>Marcelas</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but peraduenture we may meere some Sheepheard on the way to morrow that will tell them vnto vs. And for the present you will do well to goe take your rest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some roofe, for the ayre might hurt your wound, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the medicine be such that I haue applied to it, that any contrary accidents needes not much to bee feared. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> being wholly out of patience with the Goat-heards long discourse, did sollicite for his part his Master so effectually as he brought him at last into <hi>Peters</hi> Cabin to take his rest for that night; whereinto after he had entred, he bestowed the remnant of the night in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of his Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in imitation of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celas</hi> louers. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> did lay himselfe downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Rozinante</hi> and his Asse, and slept it out, not like a disfauored louer, but like a man stamped and bruised with tramplings.</p>

And they had not yet gone a quarter of a league,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:173111:59"/> when at the crossing of a path-way they saw sixe Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards comming towards them, apparrelled with blacke skinnes, and crowned with Garlands of <hi>Cypresse</hi> and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Enula campana.</hi> Euery one of them caried in his hand a thicke trun cheon of Elme. There came likewise with them two Gentlemen a horse-backe, very well furnished for the way, with other three Lackeyes that attended on them. And as soone as they encountred, they saluted one another courteously, and demaunded whether they trauelled; and knowing that they all went towards the place of the buriall they began their iourney together. One of the horse-men speaking to his companion, said, I thinke (M. <hi>Viualdo)</hi> we shal account the time wel imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we shall stay to see this so famous an intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it cannot chuse but be famous according to the wonderfull things these Shephers haue recounted vnto vs, as well of the dead Sheepheard, as also of the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Pastora.</hi> It seemes so to me likewise, quoth <hi>Viual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>do.</hi> And I say I would not onely stay one day, but a whole weeke rather then misse to behold it. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of them what they had heard of <hi>Marcela</hi> and <hi>Chrisostome?</hi> The traueller answered, that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred that morning with those Sheepheards, and that by reason they had seene them apparrelled in that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attire, they demaunded of them the occasion thereof, and one of them rehearsed it, recounting the strangenesse and beauty of a certaine <hi>Pastora</hi> called <hi>Marcela;</hi> and the amorous pursuits of her by many, with the death of that <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> to whose buriall they rode. Finally, he tolde all that againe to him, that <hi>Peter</hi> had tolde the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>This discourse thus ended, another began, and was, that he who was called <hi>Viualdo,</hi> demaunded of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> the occasion that moued him to trauell thus armed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough so peaceable a countrey? To whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, the profession of my exercise doth not license
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173111:60"/> or permit me to doe other: good dayes, cockering and ease were inuented for soft Courtiers; but trauell, vnrest, and armes were only inuented and made for those which the world termes Knights errant, of which number I my selfe (although vnworthy) am one, and the least of all. Scarce had they heard him say this, when they all helde him to be wood. And to finde out the truth better, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualdo</hi> did aske him againe, what meant the word <hi>Knights errant?</hi>
                  <q>Haue not you read then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Histories and Annals of England, wherein are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the famous actes of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually call in our <hi>Castilian Romance</hi> King <hi>Artus?</hi> of whom it is an auncient and common tradition in the Kingdome of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> that hee neuer died, but that he was turned by art of inchantment into a <hi>Crow,</hi> and that in processe of time he shall returne againe to raigne, and recouer his Scepter and Kingdome. For which reason, it cannot be proued that euer since that time vntill this, any Englishman hath killed a Crow. In this good Kings time was first instituted the famous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood of the Knights of the <hi>Round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and the loue that is there recounted, did in euery respect passe as it is laid down betweene Sir <hi>Launcelot du Lake,</hi> and Queene <hi>Geneuer</hi> the honourable Ladie <hi>Quintaniona</hi> being a dealer, and priuie thereto. Whence sprung that so famous a dittie, and so celebrated here in <hi>Spaine</hi> of, <hi>Neuer was Knight of Ladies so well serued as</hi> Launcelot <hi>when that he in Britanie arriued, &amp;c.</hi> With that progresse so sweet and delightfull of his amorous and valiant actes: and from that time forward the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knight went from hand to hand, dilating and spreading it selfe through many and sundry parts of the world: and in it were famous and renouned for their feats of armes, the valiant <hi>Amadis du Gaule,</hi> with all his progenie vntill the fift generation: and the valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> &amp; the neuer-duely pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173111:60"/> sed <hi>Tirante the white,</hi> together with Sir <hi>Beuis</hi> of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> Sir <hi>Eglemore,</hi> with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that nation and age. And almost in our dayes we saw, and communed, &amp; heard of the inuincible and valiant Knight <hi>Don Belianis of Greece.</hi> This then good Sirs is to be a Knight errant, and that which I haue said is the order of Chiualry: wherein, as I haue already sayd, I although a sinner, haue made profession, and the same doe I professe, that those Knights professed, whom I haue aboue mentioned; and therefore I trauell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough these solitudes and desarts, seeking aduentures, with full resolution to offer mine owne arme and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the most dangerous that fortune shall present, in the aide of weake and needy persons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By these reasons of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> the trauellers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly perceiued that he was none of the wisest, and knew the kinde of folly wherewithall he was crossed, whereat those remained wonderfully admired: that by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the others came to vnderstand it: and <hi>Ʋiualdo</hi> who was very discreete, and likewise of a pleasant disposition, to the end they might passe ouer the rest of the way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heauines vnto the rock of the burial, which the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards said was neere at hand, hee resolued to giue him further occasion to passe onward with his follies, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said vnto him. Me thinkes, Sir Knight, that you haue profest one of the most austere professions in the world. And I doe constantly hold that euen that of the <hi>Charter-house Monkes</hi> is not neere so straight. <q>It may bee as straight as our profession, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but that it should be so necessary for the world, I am within the breadth of two fingers to call it in doubt. For if wee would speake a truth, the souldier that puts in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Captaines commaund, doth no lesse then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Captaine that commaunds him. Hence I inferre that religious men doe with all peace and quietnesse seeke of heauen the good of the earth. But souldiers and we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173111:61"/> Knights doe put in execution that which they demand, defending it with the valour of our armes, and files of our swords: not vnder any roofe, but vnder the wide heauens, made as it were in Summer a marke to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Sunne beames, and in Winter to the rage of withering frosts. So that wee are the ministers of God on earth, and the armes wherewith he executeth here his iustice. And as the affaires of warre and things therunto pertayning, cannot be put in execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sweate, labour and trauell; it followes that those which professe warfare take questionlesse greater paine then those which in quiet peace and rest doe pray vnto God, that he will fauour, and assist those that neede it. I meane not therefore to affirme, nor doth it once passe through my thought, that the state of a Knight errant is as perfect as that of a retyred religious man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would inferre through that which I my selfe suffer, that it is doubtlesly more laborious, more battered, hungry, thirsty, miserable, torne and lowsie. For the Knights errant of times past did without all doubt suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much woe and miserie in the discourse of their life. And if some of them ascended at last to Empires, won by the force of their armes, in faith it cost them a great part of their sweate and bloud: and if those which mounted to so high a degree had wanted those inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and wisemen that assisted them, they would haue remained much defrauded of their desires, and greatly deceiued of their hopes.</q> I am of the same opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the traueller: but one thing among many others hath seemed to me very ill in Knights errant, which is when they perceiue themselues in any occasion to begin any great and dangerous aduenture: in which appeares manifest perill of losing their liues, they neuer in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of attempting it, remember to commend themselues to <hi>God,</hi> as euery <hi>Christian</hi> is bound to doe in like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but rather doe it to their Ladies with so great desire
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173111:61"/> and deuotion as if they were their Gods; a thing which in mine opinion smelles of gentility. <q>Sir quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they can doe no lesse in any wise, and the Knight errant which did any other, would digresse much from his duety. For now it is a receiued vse and custome of errant Chiualry, that the Knight aduen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous, who attempting of any great feate of armes shall haue his Lady in place, do mildely and amorously turne his eyes towards her, as it were by them demaunding that she doe fauour and protect him in that ambiguous traunce which he vndertakes; and moreouer if none doe heare him he is bound to say certaine wordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his teeth, by which he shall with all his heart commend himselfe to her: and of this we haue innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples in Histories. Nor is it therefore to be vnderstood that they do omit to commend themselues to God, for they haue time and leisure enough to doe it, in the progresse of the worke.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For all that, replied the traueller, there remaines in me yet one scruple, which is, that oftentimes as I haue read, some speech begins betweene two Knights errant, and from one word to another their choler begins to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and they to turne their horses, and to take vp a good piece of the fielde, and without any more adoe to runne as fast as euer they can driue to incounter againe; and in the midst of their race, doe commend themselues to their dames, and that which commonly ensues of this incountring is, that one of them fals downe throwne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the crouper of his horse, past thorow and thorow by his enemies Launce, and it befals the other, that if he had not caught fast of his horse mane, he had-likewise falne. And here I cannot perceiue how he that is slaine had any leisure to commend himselfe vnto God in the discourse of this so accelerate and hasty a worke? Me thinkes it were better that those words which he spent in his race on his Lady, were bestowed as they ought, and as euery <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:173111:62"/> is bound to bestow them. And the rather, because I coniecture that all Knights errant haue not Ladies to whom they may commend themselues, for all of them are not amorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That cannot be answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I say it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that there's any Knight errant without a Lady; for it is as proper and essential to such to be enamored, as to heauen to haue starres: and I dare warrant that no History hath yet bin seene, wherin is found a Knight errant without loues: for by the very reason that hee were found without them, he wold be conuinced to be no legitimate Knight, but a bastard, and that he entred into the Fortresse of <hi>Chiualrie,</hi> not by the gate, but by leaping ouer the <hi>Staccado</hi> like a robber and a thiefe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding replied the other, I haue read (if I doe not forget my selfe that <hi>Don Gataor,</hi> brother to the valorous <hi>Amadis du Gaule,</hi> had neuer any certain May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, to whom he might commend himselfe; and yet for all that he was nothing lesse accounted of, and was a most valiant and famous Knight. To that obiection our <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, one Swallow makes not a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. How much more that I know, that the Knight whom you alleage, was secretly very much enamoured: besides that, that his inclination of louing all Ladies well, which he thought were faire, was a naturall inclination, which he could not gouerne so well. But it is in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sufficiently verified, that yet he had one Lady whom he crowned Queen of his will, to whom he did also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himselfe very often and secretly, for hee did not a little glory to be so secret in his loues.</p>
               <p>Then Sir, if it be of the essence of all Knights errant to be in loue, quoth the traueller, then may it likewise bee presumed that you are also enamoured, seeing that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to the profession? And if you doe not prize your selfe to be as secret as <hi>Don Gataor,</hi> I doe intreate you as earnestly as I may, in all this companies name and mine
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173111:62"/> owne, that it will please you to tell vs the name, countrey, quality and beauty of your Ladie; for I am sure shee would account her selfe happy to think that all the world doth know shee is beloued and serued by so worthy a Knight as is your selfe. Here <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> breathing forth a deepe sigh, said, <q>I cannot affirme whether my sweete enemy delight or no, that the world know how much she is beloued, or that I serue her. Onely I dare auouch (answering to that which you so courteously demaunded) that her name is <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> her countrey <hi>Toboso,</hi> a Village of <hi>Mancha:</hi> her calling must be at least of a Princesse, seeing she is my Queene and Lady, her beauty soueraigne; for in her are verified and giue glorious lustre to all those impossible and <hi>Chimericall</hi> attributes of beauty, that <hi>Poets</hi> giue to their Maystres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: that her haires are golde, her forehead the Elisian fields, her brows the Arkes of heauen, her eyes Sunnes, her cheekes Roses, her lips currall, her teeth Pearles, her neck Alablaster, her bosome Marble, Iuorie her hands, and her whitenesse Snow, and the parts which modesty conceales from humane sight, such as I thinke and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the discreete consideration may prize, but neuer be able to equalize them:</q> her linage, progeny, and pedegree wee desire to know likewise, quoth <hi>Viualdo.</hi> To which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, <q>she is not of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romane <hi>Curcios, Cayos,</hi> or <hi>Scipios,</hi> nor of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne <hi>Colomnas</hi> or <hi>Vrsinos,</hi> nor of the <hi>Moncadas</hi> or <hi>Requesenes</hi> of <hi>Catalunia,</hi> and much lesse of the <hi>Rebelias</hi> and <hi>Villanouas</hi> of <hi>Valencia, Palafoxes, Nucas, Rocaber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Corelias, Alagones, Ʋrreas, Fozes</hi> and <hi>Gurreas</hi> of <hi>Aragon, Credas Manziquez Mendocas,</hi> and <hi>Guzmanes</hi> of <hi>Castile, Lancasters, Palias</hi> and <hi>Meneses</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but she is of those of <hi>Toboso</hi> of the <hi>Mancha;</hi> a linage, which though it be moderne is such as may giue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous beginning to the most noble families of ensuing ages. And let none contradict me in this, if it be not

This is it, answered <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> for many times my vnfortunate friend recounted to me in it the History of his mishaps: euen there he tolde me that he had seene that cruell enemy of mankinde first; and there it was, wher he first broke his affection to as honest as they were amorous: and there was the last time, wherein <hi>Marcela</hi> did end to resolue, and began to disdaine him, in such sort as she set end to the Tragedie of his miserable life. And here in memory of so many misfortunes, he commaunded himselfe to be committed to the bowels of eternall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion, and conuerting himselfe to <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> and to the other trauellers he said: I his body Sirs which you do now behold with pitifull eyes, was the depository of a soule wherein heauen had hourded vp an infinite part of his treasures. This is the body of <hi>Grisostome,</hi> who was peerelesse in wit, without fellow for courtesie, rare for comlinesse, a Phoenix for friendship, magnificent without measure, graue without presumption, pleasant without offence; and finally the first in all that which is good, and second to none in all vnfortunate mischances. He loued well, and was hated; he adored and was disdained; hee prayed to one no lesse sauage then a beast; he importu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173111:64"/> a heart as hard a Marble; he pursued the winde, he cried to desarts, he serued ingratitude, and he obtayned for reward the spoyles of death in the midst of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere of his life: to which a Sheepheardesse hath giuen end whom he laboured to eternize, to the end she might euer liue in the memories of men: as those papers which you see there might very well proue, had he not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to sacrifice them to the fire, as soone as his body was rendred to the earth.</p>
               <p>If you did so quoth <hi>Viualdo,</hi> you would vse greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and crueltie towards them then their very Lord, nor is it discreete or iustly done that his will bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, who commands any thing repugnant to reason. Nor should <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> himselfe haue gained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of wisedome, if he had permitted that to be put in execution which the diuine <hi>Mantuan</hi> had by his will ordeined. So that Seignior <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> now that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your friends body to the earth, do not therfore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his labour to obliuion: for though hee ordeined it as one iniured, yet are not you to accomplish it, as one void of discretion: but rather cause, by giuing life to these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that the crueltie of <hi>Marcela</hi> may liue eternally, that it may serue as a document to those that shall breathe in insuing ages that how they may auoide and shunne the like downefals: for both my selfe and all those that come here in my companie, doe already know the Historie of your enamoured and despairing friend, the occasion of his death, and what he commaunded eare hee deceased.

                  <hi>Grisostomes Canzone</hi> liked wonderfully all the hearers, although the reader thereof affirmed that it was not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173111:67"/> conformable to the relation that hee had receiued of <hi>Marcelas</hi> vertue and care of her selfe. For in it <hi>Grisostome</hi> did complaine of iealousies, suspicions and absence, being all of them things that did preiudice <hi>Marcelas</hi> good fame. To this obiection <hi>Ambrosio</hi> answered (as one that knew very well the most hidden secrets of his friend) you must vnderstand Sir, to the end you may better satisfie your owne doubt, that when the vnfortunate Sheepheard wrote that <hi>Canzone,</hi> he was absent from <hi>Marcela;</hi> from whose presence he had wittingly withdrawn himselfe, to see if he could deface some part of his excessiue passions, procured by absence. And as euery thing doth vexe an absent louer, and euery feare afflict him; so was <hi>Griso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stome</hi> likewise tormented by imagined iealousies, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red suspicions as much as if they were reall and true. And with this remaines the truth in her perfection and point of <hi>Marcelas</hi> vertue, who excepting that she is cruell, and somewhat arrogant, and very disdainefull, very enuy it selfe neyther ought nor can attaint her of the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. You haue reason, quoth <hi>Viualdo,</hi> and so desiring to reade another paper, hee was interrupted by a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vision (for such it seemed) that vnexpectedly offered it selfe to their view. Which was, that on the top of the rocke wherein they made the graue, appeared the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse <hi>Marcela,</hi> so faire, that her beauty surpassed farre the fame that was spread thereof; such as had not beheld her before, did looke on her then with admiration and silence: and those which were wont to view her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no lesse suspended then the others, which neuer had seene her. But scarce had <hi>Ambrosio</hi> eyed her, when with an irefull &amp; disdayning minde, he spake these words; Com'st thou by chance, O fierce Basiliske of these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to see whether the wounds of this wretch will yet bleed at thy presence? Or dost thou come to insult and vaunt in the Tragicall feats of thy sterne nature? Or to behold from that height, like another merciles <hi>Nero,</hi> the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:173111:67"/> fire of inflamed <hi>Rome?</hi> Or arrogantly to trample this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Carkasse, as the ingratefull daughter did her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tarquines?</hi> Tell vs quickly, why thou commest, or what thou dost most desire: for seeing I know that <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi> thoughts neuer disobeyed thee in life, I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cause that all those his friends shall serue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I come not here good <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> to any of those ends thou sayest, quoth <hi>Marcela,</hi> but onely to turne for mine honour, and giue the world to vnderstand how little reason haue all those which make me the authour eyther of their owne paines or of <hi>Grisostomes</hi> death; and therefore I desire all you that bee here present, to lend attention vnto me; for I meane not to spend much time, or words to perswade to the discreete, so manifest a truth. Heauen as you say, hath made me beautifull, &amp; that so much that my feature moues you to loue, almost whether you will or no. And for the affection you shew vnto me, you say, I and you affirme that I ought to loue you againe: I knowe by the naturall instinct that <hi>Ioue</hi> hath bestowed on me that each faire thing is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but I cannot conceiue, why for the reason of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloued, the partie that is so beloued for her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, should be bound to loue her louer, although he be foule. And seeing that foule things are worthy of hate, it is a bad argument to say I loue thee because faire; therefore thou must affect me, although vncomely. But set the case that the beauties occurre equall on both sides, it followes not therefore that their desires should runne one way. For all beauties doe not enamour, for some doe onely delight the sight, and subiect not the will; for if all beauties did enamour and subiect toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mens wils would euer runne confused and stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without being able to make any election; for the beautifull subiects being infinite, the desires must also perforce be infinite: and as I haue heard, true loue
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173111:68"/> brookes no diuision, and must needes be voluntary, and not enforced. Which being so, as I presume it is, why would you haue me subiect my will forcibly, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other obligation then that, that you say you loue me? If not, tell me, if heauen had made me soule, as it hath made me beautifull, could I iustly complaine of you because you affected mee not? How much more, seeing you ought to consider, that I did not chuse the beauty I haue, for such as it is, heauen bestow it <hi>gratis,</hi> without my demaunding or electing it. And euen as the Viper deserues no blame for the poyson she caries, although therewithall shee kill, seeing it was bestowed on her by nature, so doe I as little merite to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended because beautifull; for beautie in an honest woman is like fire a farre off, or a sharpe edged sword, for neyther that burnes nor this cuttes any but such as comme neere them. Honour and vertues are the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the soule, without which, the fairest body is not to be esteemed such. And if that honesty be one of the vertues that adorneth and beautifies most the body and soule, why should she that is beloued because faire, aduenture the losse thereof, to answere his intention which onely for his pleasures sake labours that she may lose it with all his force and industry? I was borne free, and because I might liue freely, I made election of the solitude of the fields. The trees of these mountains are my companions, the cleere water of these streames my mirrours. With the trees and waters I communicate my thoughts and beauty, I am a parted fire, and a sword laid aloofe. Those whom I haue enamoured with my sight, I haue vndeceiued with my wordes: And if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires be sustained by hopes, I neuer hauing giuen any to <hi>Grisostome</hi> or to any other, it may well be said that hee was rather slaine by his owne obstinacy, then by my cruelty: and if I be charged that his thoughts were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and that I was therefore obliged to answere vnto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:173111:68"/> them, I say that when in that very place where you make his Sepulchre he first broke his minde vnto mee, I told him that mine intention was to liue in perpetuall solitude, and that onely the earth should gather the fruits of my solitarinesse, and the spoyles of my beauty; and if hee would after this my resolution persist obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately without all hope, and saile against the winde, what wonder is it that he should bee drowned in the midst of the gulfe of his rashnesse? If I had intertained him, then were I false: if I had pleased him, then should I doe against my better purposes and proiects. He stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued being perswaded to the contrary: he dispaired e're he was hated. See then if it be reason that I beare the blame of his torment? Let him complaine who hath beene deceiued; let him dispaire to whom his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hopes haue failed; let him confesse it whom I shall euer call, let him vaunt whom I shall admit. But let him not call me cruell or an homicide, whom I neuer promised, deceiued, called or admitted. Heauen hath not yet ordained that I should loue by destiny, and to thinke that I will doe it by election may be excused. And let this generall caueat serue euery one of those which sollicite me for his-particular benefite: and let it be knowne that if any shall hereafter die for my loue, that he dies not iealous or vnfortunate: for whofoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loues not any, breedes not in reason iealousie in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor should any resolutions to any be accounted dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynings. He that calles me a sauage and Basiliske, let him shunne me as a hurtfull and preiudiciall thing: he that cals me vngratefull, let him not serue me: he that's strange, let him not know me: he that's cruell, let him not follow me: for this sauage, this Basiliske, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, this cruell and strange one, will neither seeke, serue, know or pursue any of them. For if <hi>Grisostomes</hi> impatience and headlong desire slew him, why should mine honest proceeding and care bee inculped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173111:69"/> if I preserue mine integrity in the society of these trees, why would any desire me to lose it, seeing euery one couets to haue the like himself, to conuerse the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among men? I haue, as you all know, riches enough of mine own, and therfore doe not couet other mens. I haue a free condition, and I doe not please to subiect me. Neyther doe I loue or hate any. I do not deceiue this man or solicite that other; not doe I jest with one, and passe the time with another. The honest conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the <hi>Pastoras</hi> of these Villages, and the care of my Goats doe intertaine me. My desires are limited by these mountaines, and if they doe issue from hence, it is to contemplate the beauty of Heauen, steps where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal the soule trauels towards her first dwelling.</q> And ending here, without desiring to heare any answer, shee turned her backe and entred into the thickest part of the wood, that was there at hand, leauing all those that were presently maruellously admired at her beauty and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Some of the Sheepheards present that were wounded by the powerfull beames of her beautiful eyes, made prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to pursue her, without reaping any profite out of her manifest resolution made there in their hearing; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> nothing, and thinking that the vse of this Chiualry did iump fitly with that occasion, by succouring distressed damzels; laying hand on the pommell of his sword, he said in loude and intelligible words: <q>Let no person of whatsoeuer state or condition he be, presume to follow the faire <hi>Marcela,</hi> vnder paine of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my furious indignation. She hath showne by cleere and sufficient reasons, the little or no fault she had in <hi>Grisostomes</hi> death, and how far she liues from meaning to condiscend to the desires of any of her louers; for which respect it is iust that in stead of being pursued and persecuted, she be honored and esteemed by all the good men of the world; for she showes in it, that it is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:173111:69"/> onely she alone, that liues therein with honest intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> Now whether it was through <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, or whether because <hi>Ambrosio</hi> requested them to conclude with the obligation they ought to their good friend; none of the Sheepheards moued or departed from thence vntill the graue being made, and <hi>Grisostomes</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers burned, they laid the body into it, with many teares of the beholders. They shut the Sepulchre with a great stone, vntill a monument were wrought, which <hi>Ambrosio</hi> said he went to haue made, with an Epitaph to this sense.</p>

And hauing trauelled in it about the space of two houres without finding of her, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in fine to a pleasant meadow, inriched with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of flourishing grasse, neere vnto which runnes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and refreshing streame, which did inuite, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them thereby to passe ouer the heat of the day, which did then beginne to enter with great feruour and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:173111:71"/> vehemencie. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> alighted, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Asse and <hi>Rozinante</hi> to the spaciousnesse of these plaines, to feede on the plenty of grasse that was there, they ransackt their Wallet, where without any ceremony the master and man did eate, with good accord and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, what they found therein. <hi>Sancho</hi> had neglected to tie <hi>Rozinante</hi> sure, that hee knew him to be so sober and little wanton, as all the Mares of the Stood of <hi>Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> could not make him to think the least sinister thought. But fortune did ordaine, or rather the Diuell who sleepes not at all houres, that a troupe of <hi>Galician</hi> Mares belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to certaine <hi>Yanguesian</hi> Carriers, did feede vp and downe in the same valley: which Carriers are wont with their beasts to passe ouer the heats in places situated neere vnto grasse and water. And that wherein <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hapned to be, was very fit for their purpose. It therefore befell that <hi>Rozinante</hi> tooke a certaine desire to sollace himselfe with the Ladie Mares, and therefore as soone as he had smelt them, abandoning his naturall pace and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, without taking leaue of his Master, he began a litle swift trot, and went to communicate his necessities to them. But they, who as it seemed, had more desire to feed then to sollace them, entertained him with their heeles and teeth in such sort, as they broke all his gyrts, and left him in his naked haire, hauing ouerthrowne the Saddle. But that which surely grieued him most was, that the Carriers perceiuing the violence that was offered by him to their Mares, repaired presently to their succours, with clubs and trunchions, and did so belabour him, as they fairely laid him along. Now in this season <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> (which beheld the bombasting of <hi>Rozinante)</hi> approached breathlesse, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi> for as much as I can perceiue friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> these men are no Knights, but base rascally people of vile quality: I say it, because thou mayest helpe me to take due reuenge, for the outrage which they haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

I am worth a hundred, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and without making any longer discourse, hee set hand to his sword, and flew vpon the <hi>Yanguesians,</hi> and <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his Lords example did the like: when with the first blow <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> piercing a buffe coate that one of them wore, wounded him grieuously in the showlder. The <hi>Yanguesians</hi> seeing themselues so rudely handled by two men onely, they being so many, ran to the stakes and trunchions of their carriage, and hemming in their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in the midst of them, they laid on them with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable speede and vehemencie. True it is that at the second peale they strucke <hi>Sancho</hi> downe to the ground, and the like hapned to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> his dexterity and courage being nothing auailable in that traunce: and his fate so ordayning he fell iust at his coursers feete, who had not yet gotten vp: by which we may ponder the fury where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall trunchions batter, being placed in wrathfull and rusticall fists. The Carriers perceiuing the euill they had committed, trussing vp their loading with all possible speede, followed on their way, leauing both the aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in a bad fashion, and a worse talent. The first that came to himselfe was <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who seeing his Lord neere vnto him, said with a weake and pitifull voyce, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> O Sir <hi>Don-Quixote!</hi> What wouldest thou haue brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied the Knight with the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate and dolefull tune? I would, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> haue of your worship, a draught or two of the liquor of <hi>Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blas,</hi> if you haue any of it at hand, perhaps it is good to cure broken bones, as well as it helpes wounds. What would we want vnhappy that I am, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if I had it here, but I sweare vnto thee <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> by the faith of a Knight errant, that before two daies passe (if fortune dispose not otherwise) I will haue it in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:173111:72"/> or it shall hardly escape my hands. I pray you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> within how many dayes thinke you, shall we be able to stir our feete? I can say of my selfe, quoth the crushed Knight, that I cannot set a certaine terme to the dayes of our recouery, but I am in the fault of all, for I should not haue drawne my sword against men that are not Knights, as well as I am, and therefore I beleeue that the God of battels hath permitted that this punishment should be giuen vnto mee, in paine of transgressing the lawes of Knighthood. Wherefore brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> it is requisite that thou beest aduertised of that which I shall say vnto thee now, for it importeth both our goods very much, and is, that when thou beholdest that the like ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Kenell doe vs any wrong, do not wait till I set hand to my sword against them; for I will not doe it in any sort. But draw thou thine, and chastise them at thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and if any Knights shall come to their assistance and succour, I shal know then how to defend thee, and offend them with all my force; for thou hast by this perceiued by a thousand signes and experiences, how farre the valor of this mine inuincible arme extendeth it selfe (so arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant remained the poore Knight, through the victory he had gotten of the hardy <hi>Biscaine.)</hi> But this aduice of his Lord seemed not so good to <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as that hee would omit to answer vnto him, saying, Sir, I am a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, quiet, and sober man, and can dissemble any iniurie, for I haue wife and children to maintaine and bring vp: wherefore let this likewise be an aduice to you (seeing it cannot be a commandement) that I will not set hand to my sword in any wise, be it against Clowne or Knight: and that from this time forward I do pardon before God all the wrongs that they haue done, or shall doe vnto me, whether they were, be, or shall be done by high or low person, rich or poore, Gentleman or Churle, without excepting any state or condition. Which being heard by his Lord, hee said; I could wish to haue breath enough,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:173111:72"/> that I might answere thee with a little more case, or that the griefe which I feele in this ribbe were asswaged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so little, that I might <hi>Panca</hi> make thee vnderstand the errour wherein thou art. Come here poore foole, if the gale of Fortune hitherto so contrarie, doe turne in our fauour swelling the sayles of our desire in such sort as we may securely and without any hinderance arriue at the Hauen of any of those Ilands, which I haue promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee what would become of thee, if I conquering it did make thee Lord thereof, seeing thou wouldest disable thy selfe in respect thou art not a Knight, nor desirest to be one, nor wouldst haue valour or will to reuenge thine iniuries, or to defend thy Lordships? For thou must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that in the Kingdomes and Prouinces newly conquered, the minds of the inhabitants are neuer so thoroughly appeased or wedded to the affection of their new Lord, that it is not to be feared, that they wil worke some noueltie to alter things againe, and turne as men say afresh to trie fortune. And it is therefore requisite that the new possessour haue vnderstanding to gouerne, and valour to offend and defend himself in any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatsoeuer. In this last that hath befallen vs quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would I had had that vnderstanding and valour of which you speake; but I vow vnto you by the faith of a poore man, that I am now fitter for plaisters then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. I pray you trie whether you can arise, and wee will helpe <hi>Rozinante,</hi> although he deserues it not, for he was the principall cause of all these troubles; I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beleeued the like before of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> whom I euer held to bee as chaste and peaceable a person as my selfe. In fine, they say well, that one must haue a long time to come to the knowledge of bodies, and that thers nothing in this life secure. Who durst affirme that after those mightie blowes which you gaue to that vnfortunate Knight Errant, would succeede so in peste, and as it were in your pursuite this so furious a tempest of staues, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:173111:73"/> hath discharged it selfe on our shoulders? Thine <hi>Sancho</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> are perhaps accustomed to beare the like showers, but mine nursed betweene <note n="*" place="margin">Sinabasas.</note> Cottons and Hollands, it is most euident that they must feele the griefe of this disgrace. And were it not that I imagine, (but why doe I say I imagine?) I know certainely that all these incommodities are annext to the exercise of armes, I would here die for very wrath and displeasure. To this the Squire answered, Sir, seeing these disgraces are of the <note n="*" place="margin">Cosecha.</note> essence of Knighthood, I pray you whether they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede very often, or whether they haue certaine times li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited wherein they befall. For mee thinkes that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two aduentures more, we shall wholly remaine disina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the third, if the Gods in mercy doe not succour vs. Know friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that the life of Knights errant is subiect to a thousand dangers and misfortunes; and it is also as well in the next degree and power to make them Kings and Emperours, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath showne in sundry Knights, of whose Histories I haue intire notice. And I could recount vnto thee now, (did the paine I suffer permit me) of some of them which haue mounted to those high degrees which I haue said, onely by the valour of their arme. And the very same men found them both before and after in diuers miseries and calamities. For the valorous <hi>Amadis of Gaule</hi> saw himselfe in the power of his mortall enemy <hi>Arcalaus</hi> the inchanter, of whom the opinion runnes infallible, that he gaue vnto him being his prisoner, more then two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred stripes with his horse bridle, after he had tied him to a piller in his base-court. And there is moreouer a secret Authour of no little credite, who sayes that the <hi>Caualier del Febo,</hi> being taken in a ginne like vnto a snatch that slipt vnder his feet, in a certaine Castell, after the fall found himselfe in a deep dungeon vnder the earth bound hands and feete; and there they gaue vnto him a glister of snow water and sand, which brought him almost to the end of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173111:73"/> his life, and were it not that hee was succoured in that great distresse, by a wise man his very great friend, it had gone ill with the poore Knight. So that I may very well passe among so many worthy persons: for the danger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and disgraces they suffred were greater then those which we doe now indure. For <hi>Sancho</hi> I would haue thee to vnderstand, that these wounds which are giuen to one with those instruments that are in ones hand by chaunce, doe not disgrace a man; and it is written in the lawes of single combat in expresse termes, that if the Shoe-maker strike another with the Last which hee hath in his hand, although it be certainly of wood, yet cannot it be said, that he who was striken got the Bastanado. I say this to the end thou maist not thinke, although we remain brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this last conflict, that therefore we be disgraced; for the armes which those men bore, and wherewithall they belaboured vs, were none other then their packe staues, &amp; as farre as I can remember, neuer a one of them had a tucke, sword, or dagger. They gaue mee no leisure, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> to looke to them so neerely, for scarce had I laide hand on my Trunchant, when they blist my shoulders with their Pines, in such sort as they wholly depriued me of my sight, and the force of my feete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, striking mee downe on the place where I yet lie straught, and where the paine of the disgrace receiued by our Cudgelling, doeth not so much pinch me, as the griefe of the blowes, which shall remaine as deepely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my memorie as they doe in my backe. For all this thou shalt vnderstand brother <hi>Panca,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that there is no remembrance, which time will not end, nor griefe which death will not consume. What greater misfortune quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> can there be then that, which onely expecteth time and death to end and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it? If this our disgrace were of that kind, which might bee cured by a payre or two of playsters, it would not be so euill; but I begin to perceiue, that all the salues
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173111:74"/> of an Hospitall will not suffice to bring them to any good termes. Leaue off <hi>Sancho,</hi> and gather strength out of weakenesse, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for so will I likewise doe, and let vs see how doth <hi>Rozinante;</hi> for me thinks that the lest part of this mishap hath not falne to his lot: you ought not to maruell at that, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing he is likewise a Knight errant; that whereat I wonder, is thatmine Asse remaines there without payment, where wee are come away without ribbes. Fortune leaues alwayes one doore open in disasters, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whereby to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die them. I say it, because that little beast may supply <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinantes</hi> want, by carying of me from hence vnto some Castell, wherein I may be cured of my wounds. Nor do I hold this kinde of riding dishonourable; for I remember to haue read that the good old <hi>Stlenus</hi> tutor of the merry God of laughter, when hee entred into the Citie of the hundred gates, rode very fairely mounted on a goodly Asse. It is like, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that he rode as you say vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an Asse; but there is great difference betwixt riding and being cast athwart vpon one like a Sacke of rubbish. To this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, the wounds that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in battell, doe rather giue honour, then depriue men of it. Wherefore friend <hi>Panca</hi> doe not reply any more vnto me, but as I haue said, arise as well as thou canst, and lay me as thou pleasest vpon thy beast, and let vs depart from hence, before the night ouertake vs in these desarts. Yet I haue heard you say, quoth <hi>Panca,</hi> that it was an ordinary custome of Knights errant to sleepe in Downes and desarts, the most of the yeare, and that so to do they hold for very good hap. That is said <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,</hi> when they haue none other shift, or when they are in loue; and this is so true, as there hath beene a Knight that hath dwelt on a rocke exposed to the Sunne, and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and other annoyances of heauen for the space of two years, without his Ladies knowledge, and <hi>Amadis</hi> was one of that kind, when calling himself <hi>Beltinebros,</hi> he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:173111:74"/> dwelt in the <hi>Poore Rocke,</hi> nor doe I know punctually eight yeares or eight monethes, for I doe not remember the History well; let it suffice that there hee dwelt doing of pennance, for some disgust which I know not, that his Ladie <hi>Oriana</hi> did him. But leauing that apart <hi>Sancho,</hi> dispatch and away before some other disgrace happen like that of <hi>Rozinante</hi> to the Asse. Euen there lurkes the Diuell, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and so breathing thirty sobs and threescore sighes, and a hundred and twenty discontents and execrations against him that had brought him there, he a rose, remayning bended in the midst of the way, like vnto a Turkish bow, without being able to addresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and notwithstanding all this difficulty, he harnessed his Asse (who had beene also somewhat distracted, by the ouermuch liberty of that day) and after he hoysted vp <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante,</hi> who were he indued with a tongue to complain, would certainly haue borne his Lord and <hi>Sancho</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. In the end <hi>Sancho</hi> laid <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> on the Asse, and tied <hi>Rozinante</hi> vnto him, and leading the Asse by the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, trauelled that way which he deemed might conduct him soonest towards the high way. And fortune which guided his affaires from good to better, after he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled a little league, discouered it vnto him, neere vnto which he saw an Inne, which in despite of him, and for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> pleasure must needes be a Castle. <hi>Sancho</hi> contended that it was an Inne, and his Lord that it was not, and their controuersie indured so long, as they had leisure before they could decide it, to arriue at the lodging; into which <hi>Sancho</hi> without farther verifying of the dispute, entred with all his loading.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Inkeeper seeing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart vpon the Asse, demaunded of <hi>Sancho,</hi> what disease he had? <hi>Sancho</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that it was nothing but a fal down from a rock, and that his ribs were therby somewhat bruised. This Inkeeper had a wife, not of the condition that those of that trade are wont to be, for she was of a charitable nature, and would grieue at the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of her neighbours, and did therefore presently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to cure <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> causing her daughter a very comely yong mayden to assist her to cure her guest. There likewise serued in the Inne an <hi>Asturian</hi> wench, who was broad-faced, flat-pated, saddle-nosed, blinde of one eye, and the other almost out; true it is that the comelinesse of her bodie supplied all the other defects. She was not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen palmes long from her feete vnto her head, and her shoulders which did somwhat burden her, made her look oftner to the ground then she would willingly. This beautifull piece did assist the young mayden, and both of them made a very bad bedde for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in an olde wide chamber, which gaue manifest tokens of it selfe, that it had sometimes serued many yeares only to keepe chopt straw for horses; in which was also lodged a Carrier, whose bedde was made a little way off from <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otes,</hi> which though it was made of Canuasse, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of his Mules, was much better then the Knights, that onely contained foure boords roughly plained, placed on two vnequall tressels; <hi>A flockebed, which in the thinnesse seemed rather a Quilt;</hi> full of pellets, and had not they showen that they were wooll, through certaine breaches
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173111:75"/> made by antiquity on the Ticke, a man would by the hardnesse rather take them to be stones: a paire of sheets made of the skinnes of Sargets, and a couerlet whose threedes, if a man would number, he should not lose one onely of the account. In this vngratious bed did <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lie, and presently the hostesse and her daughter annoint him all ouer, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> (for so the <hi>Asturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> wench was called) did holde the candle. The Hostesse at the playstring of him, perceiuing him to be so bruised in sundry places, she said vnto him that those signes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemed to proceed of blowes then of a fall. They were not blowes, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> but the rocke had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sharpe ends and knobs on it, whereof euery one left behinde it a token; and I desire you good Masters, quoth he, to leaue some flaxe behinde, and there shall not want one that needeth the vse of them; for I assure you my backe doth likewise ake. If that be so, quoth the Hostesse, it is likely that thou didst also fall: I did not fall, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> but with the suddaine affright that I tooke at my Masters fall, my body doth so grieue me, as mee thinkes, I haue beene handsomely belaboured. It may wel happen as thou saiest, quoth the Hostlers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for it hath befalne me sundry times to dreame, that I fell downe from some high tower, and could neuer come to the ground: and when I awaked, I did finde my selfe so troubled, and broken as if I had verily falne. There is the point Masters, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> that I without drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at all, but being more awake then I am at this houre, found my selfe to haue very few lesse tokens and markes then my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hath. How is this Gentleman called, quoth <hi>Maritornes</hi> the <hi>Asturian? Don-Quixote of the Mancha,</hi> replied <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and he is a Knight errant, and one of the best and strongest that haue beene seene in the world these many ages. What is that, a Knight errant quoth the wench? Art thou so yong in the world, that thou knowest it not, answered <hi>Sancho
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:173111:76"/> Panca?</hi> Know then sister mine, that a Knight errant is a thing, which in two words you see wel cudgelled, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes an Emperour. Today he is the most vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate creature of the world, and the most needy; and to morrow he wil haue two or three crowns of Kingdomes to bestow vpon his Squire. If it be so, quoth the Hostesse, why then hast not thou gotten at least an Earledome, seeing thou art this good Knight his Squire? It is yet too soone, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> for it is but a moneth sithence wee began first to seeke aduentures; and we haue not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred any worthy of the name. And sometimes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals that searching for one thing we encounter another. True it is that if my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> recouer of this wound or fall, and that I be not changed by it, I would not make an exchange of my hopes for the best title of Spaine. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did very attentiuely listen vnto all these discourses, and sitting vp in his bedde as well as hee could, taking his Hostesse by the hand, hee said vnto her: <q>Beleeue me beautifull Lady, that you may count your selfe fortunate; for hauing harboured my person in this your Castle, which is such, that if I doe not praise it, it is because men say, that proper praise stinkes, but my Squire will informe you what I am: onely this I will say my selfe, that I will keepe eternally written in my memory the seruice that you haue done vnto me, to be gratefull vnto you for it whilst I liue. And I would it might please the highest heauens that loue held mee not so inthralled and subiect to his lawes as he doth, and to the eyes of that ingratefull faire, whose name I secretly mutter, then should those of this beautifull damzell presently signiorize my liberty.</q> The Hostesse, her daughter, and the good <hi>Maritornes</hi> remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, hearing the speech of our Knight errant, which they vnderstood as well as if hee had spoken Greeke vnto them, but yet they conceiued that they were wordes of complements and loue, and as people vnused to heare the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:173111:76"/> like language, they beheld and admired him, and hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them a man of the other world, and so retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him thankes, with Tauernly phrase for his large of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they departed. And the <hi>Asturian Maritornes</hi> cured <hi>Sancho,</hi> who needed her helpe no lesse then his Master.</p>
               <p>The Carrier and she had agreed to passe the night to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and she had giuen vnto him her word, that when the guests were quiet and her Master sleeping, she would come vnto him, and satisfie his desire, as much as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And it is said of this good wench, that she neuer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the like promise, but that she performed it, although it were giuen in the midst of a wood, and without any witnesse; for shee presumed to be of gentle bloud, and yet shee held it to be no disgrace to serue in an Inne, for shee was wont to affirme that disgraces and misfortunes brought her to that state. The hard, narrow, niggard, and counterfait bedde, whereon <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lay, was the first of the foure, and next vnto it was his Squires, that only contained a matte and a couerlet, and rather seemed to be of shorne Canuasse, then wooll. After these two beddes followed that of the Carrier, made as wee haue said, of the pannels and furniture of two of his best Mules, although they were twelue all in number, faire, fat, and goodly beasts, for he was one of the richest Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of <hi>Areualo,</hi> as the Author of this history affirmeth, who maketh particular mention of him, because he knew him very well, <note n="*" place="margin">Here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor taxeth some one cunningly to be descended of a Moorishrace.</note> and besides some men say that hee was somewhat a kinne vnto him. Omitting that <hi>Cid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamat Benengeli</hi> was a very exact Historiographer, and most curious in all things, as may be gathered very well, seeing that those which are related being so minute and triuiall; he would not ouer slip them in silence.</p>
               <p>By which those graue Historiographers may take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which recount vnto vs matters so short and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly, as they doe scarse arriue to our knowledge, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the most substantiall part of the works drowned in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:173111:77"/> the inkehorne, either through negligence, malice, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Many good fortunes beside the Authour of <hi>Tablante de Ricamonte,</hi> and him that wrote the booke wherein are rehearsed the acts of the <hi>Counte Tomillas,</hi> Lord with what precisenesse doe they describe euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance? to conclude, I say, that after the Carrier had visited his Mules, and giuen vnto them their second ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he stretched himselfe in his couerlets, and expected the comming of the most exquisite <hi>Maritornes. Sancho</hi> was also by this plaistered and laid downe in his bedde, and though he desired to sleepe, yet would not the griefe of his ribbes permit him. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with the paine of his sides, lay with both his eyes open like a hare. All the Inne was drowned in silence, and there was no other light in it, then that of a lampe, which hung ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the midst of the entry. This maruailous quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the thoughts which alwaies represented to our Knight the memory of the successes, which at euery pace are recounted in bookes of Knighthood (the principall Authours of his mishap) called to his imagination one of the strangest follies that easily may be coniectured, which was, he imagined that he arriued to a famous Castle (for as we haue said, all the Innes wherein he lodged seemed vnto him to be such) and that the Inne-keepers daughter was the Lord of the Castels, who ouercome by his comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and valour, was enamoured of him, and had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that shee would come to solace with him for a good space, after her Father and Mother had gone to bedde. And howling all this quimera and fiction, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had built in his braine for most firme and certaine, he beganne to be vexed in minde, and to thinke on the dangerous trance, wherein his honesty was like to fall, and did firmely purpose in heart not to commit any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie against his Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> although very <hi>Queene Geneuer</hi> with her Lady <hi>Queintanonia,</hi> should come to sollicite him. Whilest thus hee lay thinking of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173111:77"/> these <note n="*" place="margin">Desperates.</note> follies, the houre approched (that was vnlucky for him) wherein the <hi>Asturian</hi> wench should come, who entred into the chamber in search of her Carrier, in her smocke, barefooted, and her haire trust vp in a coife of fustian, with soft and wary steps. But shee was scarse come to the dore, when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> felt her, and ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and sitting vp in his bedde in despite of his <note n="a" place="margin">Bismas.</note> plasters, and with great griefe of his ribbes, he stretched forth his armes to receiue his beautifull Damzell, the <hi>Asturian,</hi> who crouching, and silently went groping with her hands, to finde out her sweet heart, and incountred with <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> armes, who presently seazed very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon one of her wrests, and drawing her towards him (shee daring not to speake a word) be caused her to sit vpon his beddes side, and presently groped her smocke, and although it was of <note n="b" place="margin">Harpiller.</note> the strongest Canuasse, hee thought it was most subtile and fine holland. Shee wore on her wrests certaine bracelets of glasse, which he estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be precious, Orientall pearles. Her haire which was almost as rough as a horse taile, he held to be wires of the glistringest gold of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whose brightnesse did obscure that of the Sunne. And her breath which certainly smelled like to stale salt fish, reserued from ouer night, seemed vnto him a most redolent, aromaticall and sweet smell, and finally he painted her in his phantasie of the same very forme and manner; as hee had read in his bookes of Knighthood, of a certaine Princesse which came to visit a Knight who was grieuously wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouercome by his loue, embellished with all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that here we haue recounted: and the blindnesse of this poore Gallant was such, as neither the touching, sauour, or other things that accompanied the good Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, could vndeceiue him, being such as were able to make any other, saue a Carrier, vomit vp his bowels, but rather he made full account, that he held the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of loue betweene his armes, and holding her still
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173111:78"/> very fast, hee beganne to court her with a low and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous voice in this manner. <q>I could wish to finde my selfe in termes most high and beautifull Lady, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recompence so great a fauour, as that which with the presence of your matchlesse feature you haue shewen vnto me: but fortune (who is neuer weary of persecuting the good) hath pleased to lay mee in this bedde, therein I lie so broken and brused, that although I were desirous to satisfie your will, yet is it impossible; specially seeing to thy impossibility may bee added a greater, to wit the promised faith which I haue giuen to the vnmatchable <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> the only Lady of my most hidden thoughts, for did not this let mee, doe not hold me to be so senselesse and madde a Knight as to ouerslip so fortunate an occasion as this, which your bounty hath offered to me.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Maritornes</hi> remained sweating through anxiety to see her selfe held so fast by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderstanding, or giuing attention to his wordes, shee laboured all that shee could to free her selfe from him without speaking a word. The Carrier whose badde intention kept him still waking, did feare his Lady from the time that shee first entred into the roome, and did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely giue eare to all <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> discourses, and iealous that the <hi>Asturian</hi> should breake promise with him for any other, he drew nearer vnto <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> bedde, and stoode quiet to see whereunto those wordes which hee could not vnderstand tended. But viewing that the wench striued to depart, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laboured to with-hold her, the iest seeming euill vnto him, he vp with his arme, and discharged so terrible a blow on the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured Knights jawes, as hee bathed all his mouth in bloud, and not content here withall, he mounted vpon the Knight, and did treade on his ribbes, and passed them all ouer with more then a trotte. The bedde which was somewhat <note n="*" place="margin">Endeble.</note> vveake, and not very firme of foundation,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:173111:78"/> being vnable to suffer the addition of the Carrier, fell downe to the ground, vvith so great a noise, as it vvaked the Innekeeper; vvho presently suspecting, that it vvas one of <hi>Maritornes</hi> conflicts, because shee answered him not, hauing called her lowdly, hee forthwith arose and lighting of a lampe he vvent towards the place vvhere he heard the noise. The vvench perceiuing that her Master came, and that he vvas extreme chollericke, did all asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and troubled runne into <hi>Sancho Panca's</hi> bedde, who slept all this vvhile very soundly, and there crouched, and made her selfe as little as an egge. Her Master entered crying, vvhoore vvhere art thou? I dare vvarrant that these are some of thy doings. By this <hi>Sancho</hi> avvaked, and feeling that bulke lying almost vvholly vpon him, he thought it vvas the night Mare, and beganne to lay vvith his fists here &amp; there about him very swiftly, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wraught <hi>Maritornes</hi> I know not how many blows; vvho grieued for the paine shee indured there casting all honesty aside, gaue <hi>Sancho</hi> the exchange of his blowes so trimly, as shee made him to awake in despite of his slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse. And finding himselfe to be so abused of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth person, vvhom he could not behold, he arose and caught hold of <hi>Maritornes</hi> as vvell as he could, and they both beganne the best fight and pleasantest skirmish of the vvorld.</p>
               <p>The Carrier perceiuing by the light vvhich the Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper brought in vvith him, the lamentable state of his Mistris, abandoning <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he instantly repaired to giue her the succor that vvas requisite, vvhich likewise the Innekeeper did, but vvith an other meaning, for hee approched vvith intention to punish the vvench, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that shee vvas infallibly the cause of all that harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And so as men say, the Cat to the Rat, the Rat to the Cord, the Cord to the Post; so the Carrier strucke <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, Sancho</hi> the vvench, shee returned him againe his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality vvith interest, and the Innekeeper laide lode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:173111:79"/> his maide also. And all of them did mince it with such expedition, as there was no leasure at all allowed to any one of them for breathing. And the best of all was, that the Innekeepers lampe went out, and then finding themselues in darkenesse, they belaboured one another so without compassion, and at once, as wheresoeuer the blow fell, it brused the place pittifully.</p>

And saying to the first whom hee met, was the poore battered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who lay ouerthrowne in his bedde, stretched, with his face vpward without any feeling, and taking hold of his beard, he cryed out incessantly, helpe the Iustice. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee whom hee held fast bowed neither hand or foote, hee presently thought that hee was dead, and that those battaillants that fought so eagerly in the roome had slaine him; wherefore hee listed his voice and cryed out lowdly, saying, shut the Inne dore, and see that none escape, for here they haue kild a man. This word asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished all the combattants so much, as euery one left the battaile in the very termes, wherein this voice had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken them.

The officer of the holy brotherhood in this space, letting slip poore <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> beard, went out for light, to search and apprehend the delinquents, but he could not finde any, for the Innekeeper had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely quenched the lampe, as hee retyred to his bedde wherefore the officer was constrained to repaire to the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this time <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was come to himselfe againe out of his trance, and with the like lamentable note, as that wherewithall he had called his Squire the day before, when he was ouerthrowne in the value of the Packe-slaues, he called to him, saying, friend <hi>Sancho</hi> art thou a sleepe? sleepest thou friend <hi>Sancho?</hi> what I a sleepe? I renounce my selfe quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> full of griefe and despite, if I thinke not all the Diuels in hell haue beene visiting of mee here this night. Thou maiest certainly beleeue it replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for either I know very little, or else this Castle is inchanted. For I let thee to wit, but thou must first sweare to keepe secret that which I meane to tell thee now vntill after my death. So I sweare, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I say it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because I cannot abide to take away any bodies honour. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I sweare that I will conceale it vntill after your Worships daies, and I pray God that I may discouer it to morrow. Haue I wrought thee such harme, <hi>Sancho</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Knight, as thou wouldest desire to see me end so soone? it is not for that Sir quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but because I cannot abide to keepe things long, lest they should rotte in my custody; let it be for what thou pleasest said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:173111:80"/>
                  <q>for I doe trust greater matters then that to thy loue and curtesie. And that I may rehearse it vnto thee briefly, know that a little while since the Lord of this Castels Daughter came vnto me, who is the most faire and beautifull Damzell, that can bee found in a great part of the earth, what could I say vnto thee of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of her person? what of her excellent wit? what of other secret things, which, that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the faith due vnto my Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> I passe ouer in silence? I will only tell thee, that heauen enuious of the inestimable good that fortune had put in my hands. Or perhaps (and that is most probable) this Castell, as I haue said, is inchanted, iust at the time when wee were in most sweet and amourous speech, I being not able to see or know from whence it came, there arriued a hand ioyned to the arme of some migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Giant, and gaue mee such a blow on the jawes, as they remaine all bathed in bloud, and did after so thumpe and brusemee, as I feele my selfe worse now, then yesterday when the Carriers through <hi>Rozinantes</hi> madnesse, did vse vs as thou knowest. By which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that the treasure of this Damzels beauty, is kept by some inchanted Moore, and is not reserued for me.</q> Nor for me quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I haue beene bumbasted by more then foure hundred Moores, which haue ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered me in such sort, as the brusing of the Packe-slaues, was gilded bread and spice cakes in comparison of it: but Sir I pray you tell me, how can you call this a good and rare aduenture, seeing we remaine so pittifully vsed after it? and yet your harmes may be accounted lesse, in respect you haue held, as you said, that incomparable beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your armes: but I, what haue I had other then the greatest blowes that I shall euer haue in my life. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that I am, and the Mother which bare me, that neither am an errant Knight, nor euer meanes to be any, &amp; yet the greatest part of our mishaps stil fals to my lot. It
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:173111:80"/> seemes that thou wast likewise beaten, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> euill befall my linage quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> haue not I told you I was? be not grieued friend replied the Knight, for I will now compound the precious <hi>Balsamum,</hi> which will cure vs in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
               <p>The officer hauing by this time alighted his lampe, entred into the roome to see him, whom he accounted to be dead, and as soone as <hi>Sancho</hi> saw him, seeing him to come in, in his shirt, his head lapt vp in a kerchiffe, the lampe in his hand, hauing withall a very euill fauoured countenance, hee demaunded of his Lord. Sir is this by chance the inchanted <hi>Moore,</hi> that turnes a new to torment vs, for somwhat that is yet vnpunished? He cannot be the Moore answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for Nigromancers suffer not themselues to bee seene by any. If they suffer not themselues to bee seene quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at least to bee felt, if not, let my shoulders beare witnesse. So might mine also said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this is no sufficient argument to proue him, whom wee see to bee the inchanted Moore; as thus they discoursed, the officer arriued, and finding them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune in so peaceable &amp; quiet manner, he rested admired. Yet <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lay with his face vpward as he had left him, and was not able to stirre himselfe, he was so beaten and be plaistered. The officer approching demaunded of him. Well how dost thou good fellow? I would speake more mannerly quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if I were but such a one as thou art, is it the custome of this Countrey you bottle-head, to talke after so rude a manner to Knights errant? The other impatient, to see one of so vile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, vse him with that badde language, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, but lifting vp the lampe oile and all, gaue <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> such a blow on the pate with it, as he broke his head in one or two places, and leauing all in darkenesse behinde him, departed presently out of the chamber, without doubt (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing this accident) Sir
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:173111:81"/> that was the inchanted <hi>Moore,</hi> and I thinke he keepeth the treasure for others, and reserueth only for vs fists, and lampe blowes. It is as thou saiest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore wee are not to make account of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, or be wroth and angry at them, for in respect that they are inuisible and fantasticall, wee shall not find him on whom we may take reuenge, though wee labour euer so much to doe it. Arise therefore <hi>Sancho</hi> if thou beest able, and call to the Constable of this Fortresse, and procure me some oile, wine, salt, and vineger, that I make the wholsome <hi>Balsamum,</hi> for verily I beleeue that I doe neede it very much at this time, the bloud runneth so fast out of the wound which the spirit gaue mee euen now. <hi>Sancho</hi> then got vp with griefe enough of his bones, and went without light towards the Innekeepers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred on the way the officer of the holy brotherhood who stood hearkning what did become of his enemy; to whom hee said; Sir whosoeuer thou beest I desire thee, doe vs the fauour and benefit to giue me a little Rosma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Oile, Wine, and Salt, to cure one of the best Knights errant that is in the earth, who lieth now in that bed sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded by the hands of an inchanted Moore, that is in this Inne. When the officer heard him speake in that manner, hee held him to bee out of his wits, and because the dawning beganne, he opened the Inne dore, and told vnto the Host, that which <hi>Sancho</hi> demanded. The Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper presently prouided all that he wanted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> carried it to his Master, who held his head betweene both his hands, and complained much of the griefe that the blow of his head caused, which did him no other hurt then to raise vp two blisters somwhat great, and that which hee supposed to bee bloud, was only the humour which the anxiety and labour of minde he past in this last darke aduenture, had made him to sweate.</p>
               <p>In resolution <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke his simples, of which he made a compound, mixing them altogether, and then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:173111:81"/> boiling of them a good while, vntill they came (as hee thought) to their perfection, he asked for a violl wherein he might lay this precious liquor, but the Inne being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to afford him any such, hee resolued at last to put it into <note n="*" place="margin">Hosa de lata.</note> a tinne oilepot, which the Host did make freely giue him, and forthwith he said ouer the pot eighty <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and as many <hi>Aues, Salues,</hi> and <hi>Creedes,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied euery word with a Crosse, in forme of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, at all which ceremonies <hi>Sancho,</hi> the Innekeeper, and the Officer of the holy brotherhood were present, for the Carrier went very soberly to dresse and make ready his Mules.</p>
               <p>The liquor being made, he himselfe would presently make experience of the vertue of that precious <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> as he did imagine it to be, and so did drinke a good draught of the ouerplus that could not enter into his pot, being a quart or there abouts, and scarce had he done it; when he began to vomit so extremely, as he left nothing vncast vp in his stomacke, and through the paine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation caused by his vomits, hee fell into a very aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and great sweate, and therefore commanded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee well couered, and left alone to take his ease. Which was done forthwith, and hee slept three houres, and then awaking, found himselfe so wonderfully eased, and free from all brusing and paine, as hee doubted not but that he was throughly whole; and therefore did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perswade himselfe, that hee had hapned on the right manner of compounding the <hi>Balsamum of Fierabras:</hi> and that hauing that medicine, hee might boldly from thence forth, vndertake any ruines, battailes, conflicts, or aduentures, how dangerous soeuer: <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> who likewise attributed the suddaine cure of his Master to miracle, requested, that it would please him to giue him leaue to sippe vp the remainder of the <hi>Balsamum,</hi> which rested in the kettle, and was no small quantity; which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> granted, and he lifting it vp between
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173111:82"/> both handes, did with a good faith, and better ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, quaffe it off all, being little lesse then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had drunke. The successe then of the History is, that poore <hi>Sanchos</hi> stomacke, was not so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as his Lords, wherefore before hee could cast hee was tormented with so many cruell pangues, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, sweats, and dismayes, as hee did verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe, that his last houre was come: and perceiuing himselfe to bee so afflicted and troubled, hee cursed the <hi>Balsamum,</hi> and on the Theese which had giuen it to him. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing of him in that pittifull taking, said, I beleeue <hi>Sancho,</hi> all this euill befalleth thee, because thou art not dubbed Knight: for I perswade my selfe, that this liquor cannot helpe any one that is not. If your Worship knew that, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> (euill befall mee and all my Image) why did you therefore consent that I should tast it?</p>
               <p>In this time the drench had made his operation, and the poore Squire did so swift and vehemently discharge himselfe by both channels, as neither his mat, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasse couering, could serue after to any vse. Hee swet and swet againe with such excessiue swoonings, as not only himselfe, but likewise all the beholders, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deeme, that his life was ending. This storme and mishappe endured about some two howres, after which hee remayned not cured as his Master, but so vveary and indisposed, as hee vvas not able to stand.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> vvho as vvee haue said felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe eased and cured, vvould presently depart to seeke aduentures, it seeming vnto him that all the time vvhich hee aboade there, vvas no other then a depriuing, both of the world and needefull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of his fauour and assistance; and more through the security and confidence that hee had in his <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:173111:82"/> And carried thus away by this desire, hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sadled his Horse <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and did empannell his Squires beast, whome hee likewise holpe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell himselfe, and to mount vppon his Asse. And presently getring a Horse-backe, hee roade ouer to a corner of the Inne, and laide hand on a Iaueline that vvas there, to make it serue him in steede of a Launce. All the people that were in the Inne stoode beholding of him, vvhich were aboue twenty in number.</p>
               <p>The Innekeepers Daughter did also looke vppon him, and hee did neuer withdraw his eye from her, and would euer and anon breathe foorth so dolefull a sigh, as if hee had plucked it out of the bottome of his heart, vvhich all the beholders tooke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the griefe of his ribbes, but specially such as had seene him playstered the night before. And being both mounted thus a Horse-backe, hee called the Innekeeper and said vnto him with a graue and stayed voyce. <q>Many and great are the fauours, Sir Constable, vvhich I haue receiued in this your Castell, and doe remayne most obliged to gratifie you for them all the dayes of my life. And if I may pay or recompence them by reuenging of you vpon any prowde Miscreant, that hath done you any vvrongs, know that it is mine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to helpe the weake, to reuenge the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and to chastise Traytours. Call therefore to memory, and if you finde any thing of this kinde to commend to my correction, you neede not but once to say it, for I doe promise vnto you by the Order of Knighthood, which I haue receiued to satisfie and appay you according vnto your owne desire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Innekeeper answered him againe with like gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity and stayednesse, saying, Sir Knight, I shall not neede
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173111:83"/> your assistance when anywrong is done to me, for I know very well my selfe, how to take the reuenge that I shall thinke good when the iniury is offered. That only which I require is that you defray the charges whereat you haue beene here in the Inne this night, as well for the Straw and Barly giuen to your two horses, as also for both your beddes. This then is an Inne? quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> That it is and an honourable one too, replyed the Innekeeper. Then haue I hitherto liued in an errour, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for in very good sooth I tooke it till nowe to bee a Castell, and that no meane one neyther. But since that it is no Castell but an Inne, that which you may doe for the present time is to forgiue me those expences, for I cannot doe ought against the customes of Knights Errants; of all which I most certainely knowe (without euer hauing read vntill this present any thing to the contrarie) that they neuer paide for their lodging, or other thing, in any Inne wheresoeuer they lay. For by all Law and right, any good entertainement that is giuen vnto them is their due, in recompence of the insupportable trauels they indure, seeking of aduentures both day and night, in Summer and Winter, a foote and a horsebacke, with thirst and hunger, in heate and cold, being subiect to all the distemperatures of Heauen, and all the discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the earth. All that concernes me nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Inkeeper, pay vnto me my due, and leaue these tales and Knighthoods apart, for I care for nothing else, but how I may come by mine owne. Thou art a mad and a bad Hoste, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and saying so he spurd <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and flourishing with his Iaueline, hee issued out of the Inne, in despight of them all, and without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king behind him to see once whether his squire followed, he roade a good way off from it.</p>
               <p>The Inkeeper seeing hee departed without satisfying him, came to <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> to get his money of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:173111:83"/> him, who answered, that since his Lord would not pay, he would likewise giue nothing, for being, as hee was Squire to a Knight Errand, the very same rule and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that exempted his Master from payments in Innes and Tauernes ought also to serue, and be vnderstood as well of him. The Inkeeper grew wroth at these words and threatned him, that if hee did not pay him speedily, hee would recouer it in manner that would grieue him. <hi>Sancho</hi> replied, swearing by the order of Knighthood which his Lord had receiued, that hee would not pay one denier, though it cost him his life, for the good and auncient customes of Knights Errants, should neuer through his default bee infringed, nor should their Squires which were yet to come into the world euer complaine on him, or vpbraide him for transgressing or breaking so iust a duetie. But his bad fortune ordained that there were at the very time in the same Inne fowre Clothiers of <hi>Segouia,</hi> and three Point-makers of the Stewes of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> and two neighbours of the Market of <hi>Siuill,</hi> all pleasant folke, well minded, malicious, and playsome, all which pricked and in a manner moued all at one time and by the very same spirit came neere to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and pulling him downe off his Asse, one of them ranne in for the Inkeepers Couerlet, and casting him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, they looked vp and seeing the House was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too low for their intended businesse, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to goe into the base Court, which was ouer head onely limitted by heauen, and then <hi>Sancho</hi> being laide in the midst of the Blanket, they began to tosse him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft and sport themselues with him, in the maner they were wont to vse Dogges at Shrouetide. The out-cries of the miserable betossed Squire were so many and so lowde, as they arriued at last to his Lords hearing, who standing a while to listen attentiuely what it was, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that some new aduenture did approach, vntill hee perceiued at last that hee which cried was his Squire,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173111:84"/> wherefore turning the Raignes, hee made towards the Inne with a loathsome galloppe, and finding it shut, he rode all about it to see whether hee might enter into it. But scarce was he arriued at the walles of the base court which were not very hie, when he perceiued, the foule play that was vsed towards his Squire, for hee saw him descend and ascend into the ayre againe with such grace and agilitie, that did his choller permit, I certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade my selfe hee would haue burst for laughter. He assayed to mount the wall from his Horse, but hee was so bruised and broken, as he could not doe as much as a light from his backe. Wherefore from his backe he vsed such reprochfull and vile language to those which tossed <hi>Sancha,</hi> as it is impossible to lay them downe in writing. And notwithstanding all his scornefull speech, yet did not they cease from their laughter and labour, nor the flying <hi>Sancho,</hi> from his complaints, now and then medled with threats, now and then with intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but auailed very little, nor could preuaile, vntill they were constrained by wearinesse to giue him ouer. Then did they bring him his Asse againe, and helping him vp vpon it, they lapt him in his <note n="*" place="margin">Gauay.</note> mantle. And the compassionate <hi>Maritornes</hi> beholding him so afflicted and orelaboured, thought it needfull to helpe him to a draught of water, and so brought it him from the well, because the water thereof was coolest. <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke the pot and laying it to his lips, he abstained from drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by his Lords perswasion, who cryed to him aloud saying, Sonne <hi>Sancho</hi> drinke not water, drinke it not Sonne, for it will kill thee. Behold I haue here with me the most holy <hi>Balsamum</hi> (and shewed him the oile pot of the drenches he had compounded) for with only two drops that thou drinkest, thou shalt without all doubt remaine whole and sound. At those wordes <hi>Sancho</hi> looking behinde him, answered his Master with a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der voice, haue you forgotten perhaps so soone, how
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:173111:84"/> that I am no Knight, or doe you desire, that I vomit the remnant of the poore bowels that remaine in mee since yesternight, keepe your liquor for your selfe in the Diuels name, and permit me to liue in peace; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this speech and his beginning to drinke, was done all in one instant, but finding at the first draught that it was water, he would not tast it any more, but requested <hi>Maritornes</hi> that shee would giue him some wine, which shee did streight with a very good will, and likewise paied for it out of her owne purse; for in effect it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of her, that though shee followed that trade, yet had shee some shadowes and lineaments in her of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As soone as <hi>Sancho</hi> had drunken, he visited his Asse ribs with his heeles twise or thrise, and the Inne being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened he issued out of it, very glad that he had payed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and gotten his desire, although it were to the cost of his ordinary sureties, to wit, his shoulders. Yet did the Innekeeper remaine possest of his wallets, as a payment for that he ought him, but <hi>Sancho</hi> was so distracted when he departed, as he neuer missed them. After he departed, the Innekeeper thought to haue shut vp the Inne doore againe, but the Gentlemen tossers would not permit, being such folke, that if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> were verily one of the Knights of the round Table, yet would not they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme him two chips.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein are rehearsed the discourses passed betweene <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> with other aduentures worthy the recitall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ancho</hi> arriued to his Master all wanne and dismayed, in so much as he was scarce able to spur on his beast. When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beheld him in that case, hee said to him, now do I wholly perswade my selfe friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that that Castle or Inne, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly inchanted. For those which made pastime with thee in so cruell manner, what else could they be but spirits, or people of an other world: which I doe the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, because I saw, that whilest I stoode at the barrier of the yard, beholding the acts of thy sadde Tragedy; I was not in any wise able either to mount it, or alight from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> for as I say, I thinke they held me then inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For I vow to thee by mine honour, that if I could haue either mounted or alighted, I would haue taken such vengeance on those lewde and treacherous Caitiss, as they should remember the iest for euer, though I had therefore aduentured to transgresse the lawes of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Which as I haue oftimes said vnto thee permitteth not any Knight to lay hands on one that is not Knighted, if it bee not in defence of his proper life and person, and that in case of great and vrgent necessity. So would I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so haue reuenged my selfe, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I might, were they Knights or no Knights, but I could not: and yet I do infallibly belieue, that those which tooke their pleasure with me, were neither ghosts, nor inchanted men as you say, but men of flesh and bones as we are, and all of them as I heard them cald whilest they tossed-mee had proper names, for one was tearmed <hi>Peter Martinez,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:173111:85"/>
                  <hi>Tenorio Herriander,</hi> and I heard also the Innekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per called <hi>Iohn Palameque the deafe,</hi> so that for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of not leaping ouer the barriers of the yard, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting off your horse was only inchauntments in you. Whereby I doe clearly collect this much, that these ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uentures which we goe in search of, will bring vs at last to so many disuentures, as wee shall not be able to know which is our right foote. And that which wee might doe best according to my little vnderstanding, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vs againe to our village, now that is reaping time, and looke to our goods, omitting to leape thus as they say, out of the frying pan into the fire.</p>
               <p>How little doest thou know <hi>Sancho,</hi> replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> what appertaineth to <hi>Chiualry;</hi> peace and haue patience, for a day will come wherein thou shalt see with thine owne eyes, how honourable it is to follow this ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ercise. If not, tell me, what greater content may there be in this world, or what pleasure can equall that of winning a battaile, and of triumphing ouer ones enemy? none without doubt. I thinke it be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> although I doe not know it; only this I know, that since we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Knights errant, or that you are one (for there is no reason why I should count my selfe in so honourable a number) wee neuer ouercame any battaile, if it was not that of the <hi>Biscaine,</hi> and you came euen out of the very same with halfe your eare and beauer lesse. And euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time, we haue had nothing but cudgels, and more cudgels, blowes, and more blowes. I carrying with me besides of ouerplus, the tossing in the blanket, and that, by reason it was done to me by inchanted persons, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reuenged, and by consequence shall not know that true gust and delight, that is taken by vanquishing mine enemies, whereof you speake euen now. That is it which grieues me, as it should thee also, <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> but I will procure hereafter to get a sword, made with such art, that whosoeuer shall weare it, no
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:173111:86"/> kinde of inchantment shall hurt him. And perhaps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will present mee the very same which belonged to <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he called himselfe <hi>the Knight of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sword,</hi> which was one of the best, that euer Knight had in this world: for besides the vertue that I told, it did also cut like a Razer, and no armour were it euer so strong or inchanted could stand before it. I am so fortunate, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that when this befell, and that you found such a sword, it would only serue and be beneficiall, and stand in stead such as are dubbed Knights, as doth your <hi>Balsamum,</hi> whilest the poore Squires are cramd full with sorrowes. Feare not that <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for fortune will deale with thee more liberally then so.</p>
               <p>In these discourses <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire roade, when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiuing a great and thicke dust to arise in the way, wherein he trauailed, turning to <hi>Sancho</hi> said, this is <hi>(Sancho)</hi> the day, wherein shall bee manifest the good which <hi>Fortune</hi> hath reserued for me. This is the day, wherein the force of mine arme must bee showen as much as in any other whatsoeuer, and in it will I doe such feates, as shall for euer remaine recorded in the books of fame; doest thou see <hi>Sancho</hi> the dust which ariseth there? know that it is caused by a mighty army and sundry and innumerable Nations, which come marching there; if that be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> then must there be two armies, for on this other side is raised as great a dust. <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi> turned backe to behold it, and seeing it was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, he was maruailous glad, thinking that they were doubtlessely two armies, which came to fight one with an other, in the midst of that spacious plaine. For he had his fantasie euer replenished with these battailes, inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, successes, rauings, loues, and challenges, which are rehearsed in bookes of Knighthood: and all that euer he spoke, thought, or did, was addrest and applyed to the like things: and the dust which hee had seene was raised by two great flocks of Sheepe, that came through the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173111:86"/> same field by two different wayes, and could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by reason of the dust, vntill they were very neare. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did affirme that they were two armies, with so very good earnest as <hi>Sancho</hi> beleeued it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, Sir what then shall we two doe? What should we do? (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but assist the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and weaker side. For thou shalt know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that he who comes towards vs is the great Emperor <hi>Alifam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faron,</hi> Lord of the great Island of <hi>Trapobana.</hi> The other who marcheth at our backe is his enemy the King of the <hi>Garamantes, Pentapoline of the naked arme,</hi> so called because hee still entereth in battayle, with his right arme naked. I pray you good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to tell me why these two Princes hate one another so much? they are enemies, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because that this <hi>Alifamfaron</hi> is a furious Pagan, and is enamoured of <hi>Pentapolins</hi> Daughter, who is a very beautifull and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Princesse, and moreouer a <hi>Christian.</hi> And her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuseth to giue her to the Pagan King, vntill first he abandon <hi>Mahomets</hi> false sect, and become one of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. By my beard, quoth <hi>Sancho, Pentapolin</hi> hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and I will helpe him all that I may. By doing so, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou performest thy duty; for it is not requisite that one be a Knight, to the end hee may enter into such battailes. I doe apprehend that my selfe, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> very well, but where shall we leaue this Asse in the meane time, that we may be sure to finde him againe after the conflict, for I thinke it is not the custome to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into battaile, mounted on such a beast. <q>It is true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that which thou maist doe is, to leaue him to his aduentures, and care not whether hee be lost or found, for we shall haue so many horses, after comming out of this battaile victors, that very <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> himselfe, is in danger, to be changed for another. But be attentiue, for I meane to describe vnto thee the principall Knights of both the armies. And to the end
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:173111:87"/> thou maiest the better see and note all things, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire our selues there to that little hillocke, from whence both the Armies may easily be deseryed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They did so, and standing on the toppe of a hill, from whence they might haue seene both the flocks, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> called an army very well, if the cloudes of dust had not hindred it and blinded their sight, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our Knight seeing in conceit that which really hee did not see at all, beganne to say with a lowde voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Knight which thou seest there with the yellow armour, who beares in his shield a Lyon crownd, crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at a Damzeis feete, is the valorous <hi>Laurcalio,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Siluer Bridge:</hi> the other whose armes are powdred with flowers of gold, and Beares in an Azure field, three Crownes of siluer is the dreaded <hi>Micoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembo,</hi> great Duke of <hi>Quirocia:</hi> the other limmed like a Giant, that standeth at his right hand, is the vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Brandabarbaray of Boliche,</hi> Lord of the three <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabias:</hi> and comes armed with a Serpents skinne, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for his shield as is reported one of the gates of the Temple, which <hi>Sampson</hi> at his death ouerthrew, to be reuenged of his enemies. But turne thine eyes to this other side, and thou shalt see first of all, and in the front of this other army the euer victor and neuer vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Timonel of Carcaiona,</hi> Prince <hi>of new Biskaye,</hi> who comes armed, with armes parted into Blew, Greene, White, and Yellow quarters, and beares in his shield in a field of Tawney a Catte of gold, with a letter that saies <hi>Miau,</hi> which is the beginning of his Ladies <note place="margin">Catte.</note> name, which is as the report runnes, the peerelesse <hi>Miaulina,</hi> Daughter to Duke <hi>Alfeniquen of Algarue.</hi> The other that burdens and oppresseth the backe of that mighty <note n="*" place="margin">Alfana.</note> Courser, whose armour is as white as snow, and also his shield without any deuise is a Knight nouell of France, called <hi>Pierres Papin,</hi> Lord of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173111:87"/> of <hi>Vtrique.</hi> The other that beates his horse sides with his armed heeles, and beares the armes of pure <hi>Azure,</hi> is the mighty Duke of <hi>Nerbia Espart afilardo of the Wood.</hi> Who beares for his deuise a <note n="*" place="margin">Esparraguera.</note> Harrow, with a <hi>Motto</hi> that saies, <hi>So trailes my Fortune.</hi>
                  </q> And thus he proceeded forward, naming many Knights of the one and the other squadron, euen as hee had imagined them, and attributed to each one, his armes, his colours, imprese, and <hi>Mottoes,</hi> suddainly borne away by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his wonderfull distraction. And without stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering he proceeded, saying. <q>This first squadron con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth folke of many Nations, in it are those which tast the sweet waters of famous <hi>Xante.</hi> The Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous men that treade the <hi>Mafilical fields.</hi> Those that doe sift the most pure and rare gold of <hi>Arabia Foelix.</hi> Those that possessed the famous and delightfull bankes of cleare <hi>Termodonte.</hi> Those that let bloud many and sundry waies the golden <hi>Pactolus.</hi> The <hi>Numides</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadfast in their promise. The <hi>Persians</hi> famous for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. The <hi>Parthes</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> that fight flying. The <hi>Arabs</hi> inconstant in their dwellings. The <hi>Scithes</hi> as cruell as white. The <hi>Aethiops</hi> of boared lips, and other infinite Nations whose faces I know and behold, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue forgotten their denominations. In that other army come those that tast the <hi>Christaline</hi> streams of the <hi>Oliue-bearing Betis,</hi> those that dippe and polish their faces with the liquor of the <hi>euer-rich</hi> and golden <hi>Tagus.</hi> Those that possesse the profitable fluent of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Genile.</hi> Those that trample the <hi>Tartesian fields</hi> so abundant in pasture. Those that recreat themselues in the <hi>Elisean fields of Xerez.</hi> The rich <hi>Manchegans</hi> crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ruddy eares of corne: Those apparelled with yron, the ancient relikes of the <hi>Gothish bloud.</hi> Those that bathe themselues in <hi>Pisuerga,</hi> renowmed for the smothnesse of his current. Those that feede their flocks in the vast fields of the wreathing <hi>Guadiana,</hi> so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173111:88"/> for his hidden course. Those that tremble through the cold of the busty <hi>Pirens,</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">Or white crested.</note> lofty <hi>Apenines.</hi> Finally, all those that <hi>Europe</hi> in it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Good God, how many Prouinces repeated he at that time, and how many Nations did he name, giuing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them, with maruailous celerity and briefnesse, their proper attributes, being swallowed vp and ingulfed in those things which hee had read in his lying bookes. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> stood suspended at his speech, and spoke not a word, but only would now and then turne his head to see whether he could marke those Knights and Giants, which his Lord had named; and by reason he could not discouer any, he said. Sir I giue to the Diuell any man, Giant, or Knight, of all those you said that appeareth: at least I cannot discerne them. Perhaps all is but inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like that of the Ghosts of yesternight. How? saiest thou so, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Doest not thou heare the horses neigh, the trumpets sound, and the noyse of the drummes? I heare nothing else, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> but the great bleating of many Sheepe. And so it was indeede, for by this time, the two flocks did approch them very neare. The feare that thou conceiuest <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> maketh thee that thou canst neither heare nor see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for one of the effects of feare is to trouble the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and make things appeare otherwise then they are, and seeing thou fearest so much, retire thy selfe out of the way, for I alone am sufficient to giue the victory to that part which I shall assist, and hauing ended his speech, hee set spurres to <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and setting his Lance in the rest hee flung downe from the hillocke like a thunderbolt. <hi>Sancho</hi> cryed to him as lowd as he could, saying, returne good Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I vow vnto God that all those which you goe to charge, are but Sheepe and Muttons. Returne I say, alas that euer I was borne, what madnesse is this? looke, for there is neither Giant, nor Knight, nor
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:173111:88"/> Cats, nor Armes, nor Shields, parted, nor whole, nor pure Azures, nor diuelish. What is it you doe wretch that I am? For all this <hi>Don Quixote</hi> did not returne, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roade, saying with a lowde voice; On on Knights, all you that serue and march vnder the banners of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Emperour <hi>Pentapolin of the naked Arme,</hi> follow mee all of you, and you shall see how easily I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge him on his enemy <hi>Alifamfaron of Trapobana,</hi> and saying, so hee entred into the middest of the flocke of Sheepe, and beganne to Launce them with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and fury, as if hee did in good earnest encounter his mortall enemies.</p>
               <p>The Sheepe-heards that came with the flocke, cryed to him to leaue off, but seeing their wordes tooke no effect, they vnloosed their slings and beganne to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his pate with stones as great as ones fist. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made no account of their stones, and did fling vp and downe among the Sheepe, saying, where art thou prowde <hi>Alifamfaron,</hi> where art thou? come to mee, for I am but one Knight alone, vvho desires to proue my forces with thee man to man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thee of thy life, in paine of the wrong thou doest to the valiant <hi>Pentapolin</hi> the <hi>Garamiante.</hi> At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a stone gaue him such a blow on one of his sides, as did bury two of his ribbes in his body. Hee beholding himselfe so ill dight, did presently beleeue that hee vvas either slaine or sorely wounded; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himselfe of his liquor, hee tooke out his oyle pot, and set it to his mouth to drinke, but ere he could take as much as hee thought was requisite to cure his hurts, there commeth another <hi>Almond</hi> which strucke him so full vppon the hand and oyle pot as it broke it into pecces, and carryed away with it besides three or foure of his cheeke teeth, and did moreouer bruise very sorely two of his fingers. Such was the first and the second blowe, as the poore Knight
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:173111:89"/> was constrained to fall downe off his horse. And the Sheep-heards arriuing did verily beleeue they had slaine him; and therefore gathering their flocke together with all speede, and carrying away their dead Muttons, which were more then seuen, they went away without verifying the matter any further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> remained all this while on the height, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Masters follies, pulling the haires of his beard for very despite, and cursed the houre and moment wherein hee first knew him; but seeing him ouer throwne to the earth, and the Sheep-heards fled away, hee came downe to him, and found him in very badde taking, yet had hee not quite lost the vse of his senses, to whom he said. Did not I bidde you Sir Knight returne, and told you that you went not to inuade an army of men, but a flocke of sheep. That theefe the wiseman who is mine aduersary, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> can counterfait, and make men to seeme such, or vanish away as he pleaseth, for <hi>Sancho</hi> thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to know, that it is a very easie thing for those kinde of men, to make vs seeme what they please, and this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne</hi> that persecuteth mee, enuying the glory which hee saw I was like to acquire in this battaile, hath conuerted the enemies squadrons into Sheepe; and if thou wilt not beleeue me <hi>Sancho;</hi> yet doe one thing for my sake, that thou maiest remoue thine errour, and perceiue the truth which I affirme, get vp on thine Asse and follow them faire and softly aloofe, and thou shalt see that as soone as they are parted any distance from hence, they will turne to their first forme, and leauing to be sheepe, will become men, as right and straight as I painted them to thee at the first, but goe not now for I haue neede of thy helpe and assistance, draw nearer to me and see, how many cheeke teeth and others I want, for mee thinks there is not one left in my mouth. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> approched so neare, that he laid almost his eyes on his Masters mouth, and it was iust at the time that the <hi>Balsamum</hi> had now wrought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:173111:89"/> his effect in <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his stomacke, and at the very season that <hi>Sancho</hi> went about to looke into his mouth, he disgorged all that he had in his stomacke, with as great violence as it had beene shot out of a Musket, iust in his compassiue Squires beard. O holy Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what is this that hath befallen mee, the poore man is mortally wounded without doubt, for hee vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp bloud at his mouth. But looking a little nearer to it, hee perceiued in the colour and smell that it was not bloud, but the <hi>Balsamum</hi> of his Masters oile-bottle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at hee instantly tooke such a loathing, that his stomacke likewise turned, and hee vomited out his very bowels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, all in his Masters face. And so they both remained like Pearles. Soone after, <hi>Sancho</hi> ranne to his Asse to take somewhat to cleare himselfe, and to cure his Lord out of his wallet, which when he found <note n="*" place="margin">Hauing left it behinde him in the Jnne when he ranne away and paid nothing for his lodging.</note> wanting, he was ready to runne out of his wits: there hee beganne a new to curse himselfe, and made a firme resolution in minde, that he would leaue his Master and turne to his Countrey againe, although he were sure both to loose his wages, and the hope of the Gouernment of the promised Island.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> arose, and setting his left hand to his mouth, that the rest of his teeth might not fall out, he caught hold on the raignes of <hi>Rozinantes</hi> bridle with the other, who had neuer stird from his Master: (such was his loyaltie and good nature) hee went towards his Squire, that leaned vpon his Asse, with his hand vnder his cheeke, like one pensatiue and malecontent. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing of him in that guise, with such signes of sadnesse, said vnto him. Know <hi>Sancho</hi> that one man is not more then another, if he doe not more then another. All those stormes that fall on vs are arguments that the time will waxe calme very soone, and that things will haue better successe hereafter, for it is not possible that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or ill be durable. And hence wee may collect that our misfortunes hauing lasted so long, our fortune
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:173111:90"/> and weale must bee likewise neare. And therefore thou oughtest not thus to afflict thy selfe for the disgraces that befall mee, seeing no part of them fall to thy lot. How not, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> was hee whom they to fled yesterday in the couerlet by fortune, any other mans Sonne then my Fathers? and the wallet that I want to day, with all my prouision, was it any others then mine owne? what doest thou want thy wallet <hi>Sancho?</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I, that I doe, quoth hee. In that manner replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> wee haue nothing left vs to eate to day? that would be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if we could not finde among these fields the hearbs which I haue heard you say you know, wherewithall such vnlucky Knights errant as you, are wont to supply like needes. For all that, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I would rather haue now a quarter of a loafe, or a cake and two pilchers heads, then all the hearbs that <hi>Dioscorides</hi> describeth, although they came glosed by Doctor <hi>Lagima</hi> himselfe. But yet for all that get vpon thy beast <hi>Sancho</hi> the good, and follow me, for God who is the prouider for all creatures, will not faile vs. And principally seeing we doe a worke so greatly to his seruice as we doe, seeing he doeth not abandon the little flies of the aire, nor the wormelings of the earth, nor the spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the water. And he is so mercifull that he maketh his Sunne shine on the good and the euill, and raines on sinners and iust men. You were much fitter, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> to be a Preacher, then for a Knight errant. Knights errant knew and ought to know some what of all things, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> For there hath beene a Knight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in times past, who would make a Sermon or discourse in the midst of a campe riall, with as good grace as if hee were graduated in the Vniuersity of <hi>Paris:</hi> by which we may gather that the Lance neuer dulled the Pen, nor the Pen the Lance. Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let it be as you haue said, and let vs depart hence, and procure to finde a lodging for this night, where, I pray God, may be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlets
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173111:90"/> and tossers, nor Spirits, nor inchanted Moores, for if there bee, Ile bestow the flocke and the hooke on the Diuell. Demaund that of God Sonne <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and leade me where thou pleasest, for I will leaue the election of our lodging to thy choice for this time: yet I pray thee giue mee thy hand, and feele how many cheeke teeth or others I want in this right side of the vpper jaw, for there I feele most paine. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> put in his fingers, and whilest he felt him, demanded how many cheeke teeth were you accustomed to haue on this side? foure, quoth hee, besides the hindermost; all of them very whole and sound. See well what you say Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> I say foure, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if they were not fiue, for I neuer in my life drew or lost any tooth, nor hath any fallen or beene worme-eaten, or mard by any rhume. Well then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> you haue in this nether part but two cheeke teeth and a halfe, and in the vpper, neither a halfe, nor any, for all there is as plaine as the palme of my hand. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate I (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> hearing the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newes that his Squire told vnto him) for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loose one of mine armes, so it were not that of my sword. For <hi>Sancho</hi> thou must wit, <hi>that a mouth without cheeke teeth, is like a Mill without a milstone:</hi> and a tooth is much more to bee esteemed then a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.</p>
               <p>But wee which professe the rigorous Lawes of Armes, are subiect to all these disasters, wherefore mount gentle friend and giue the way, for I will follow thee what pace thou pleasest. <hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed, and roade the way where hee thought hee might finde lodging, without leauing the high way, which was there very much bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And going thus by little and little (for <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his paine of his jawes did not suffer him rest, or make ouermuch hast,) <hi>Sancho</hi> to entertayne him and diuert his thought by saying some things, beganne to aboord

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>E thinks, good Sir, that all the mishaps that befell vs these dayes past, are without any doubt in punishment of the sinne you committed against the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by not performing the Oath you swore, not to eate bread on table clothes, nor to sport with the Queene, with all the rest which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth, and you vowed to accomplish, vntil you had wonne the Helmet of <hi>Malandrino,</hi> or I know not how the Moore is called, for I haue forgotten his name. Thou saiest right <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but to tell the truth in deede, I did wholly forget it: and thou maiest likewise thinke certainly, that because thou didest not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it to mee in time, that of the couerlet was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as a punishment on thee. But I will make amends, for we haue also manners of reconciliation for all things in the order of Knighthood. Why did I by chance sweare any thing, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> it little imports, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that thou hast not sworne, let it suffice that I know thou art not very cleare from the fault of an acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. And therefore at all aduentures it will not bee ill to prouide a remedy. If it bee so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you doe not forget this againe, as you did that of the Oath, for if you should, perhaps those spirits will take againe a fancy to solace themselues with mee, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173111:91"/> peraduenture with you your selfe, if they see you obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>Being in these and other such discourses, the night o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke them in the way, before they could discouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lodging, and that which was worst of all, they were almost famisht with hunger, for by the losse of their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, they lost at once both their prouision and warder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house. And to accomplish wholly this disgrace, there succeeded a certaine aduenture, which certainly hapned as wee lay it downe without any addition in the world, and was this; the night did shut vppe with some darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet notwithstanding they trauailed on still, <hi>Sancho</hi> beleeuing that since that was the high way, there must be within a league or two in all reason some Inne. Trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefore as I haue said, in a darke night, the Squire being hungry, and the Master hauing a good stomacke, they saw comming towards them in the very way they trauailed, a great multitude of lights, resembling nothing so well as wandering starres. <hi>Sancho</hi> beholding them was strucke into a wonderfull amazement, and his Lord was not much better. The one drew his Asse halter, the other held his horse, and both of them stoode still, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding attentiuely what that might be, and they perceiued that the lights drew still nearer vnto them; and the more they approched, they appeared the greater, at the sight <hi>Sancho</hi> did tremble like one infected by the fauour of Quicksiluer, and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> haire did stand vp like bristles, who animating himselfe a little, said, <hi>Sancho</hi> this must be questionlesse a great and most dangerous aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein it is requisite that I shew all my valour and strength. Vnfortunate I, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> if by chance this aduenture were of Ghosts, as it seemeth to me that it is, where will there bee ribbes to suffer it? bee they neuer so great Ghosts, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I will not consent that they touch one haire of thy garment: For if they lested with thee the other time, it was because I could not leape
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173111:92"/> ouer the walles of the yard, but now wee are in plaine field where I may brandish my sword as I please. And if they inchant and benumme you as they did the other time quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what will it then auaile vs to bee in open field or no? For all that replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I pray thee <hi>Sancho</hi> bee of good courage, for experience shall shew thee how great my valour is; I will and please God, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and so departing somewhat out of the way, they beganne againe to view earnestly what that of the trauailing lights might bee; and after a very little space they espied many white things, whose dreadfull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions did in that very instant conclude <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> his courage, and now beganne to chatter with his teeth, like one that had the cold of a <hi>Quartane,</hi> and when they did distinctly perceiue what it was, then did his beating and chattering of teeth increase, for they discouered about some twenty all couered with white a horse-backe, with Tapers lighting in their hands, after which followed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter couered ouer with blacke, and then insued other sixe a horse-backe, attired in mourning, and likewise their Mules, euen to the very ground; for they perceiued that they were not horses, by the quietnesse of their pace. The white folke rode murmuring somewhat among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a low and compassiue voice. Which strange vision, at such an houre, and in places not inhabited, was very sufficient to strike feare into <hi>Sanchos</hi> heart, and euen in his Masters. If it had beene any other then <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> but <hi>Sancho</hi> tumbled here and there, being quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne with terrour. The contrary hapned to his Lord, to whom in that same houre his imagination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented vnto him most liuely, the aduenture wherein hee was to bee such a one, as hee oftimes had read in his bookes of Chiualry. For it is figured vnto him, that the litter was a beere, wherein was carryed some grieuously wounded or dead Knight, whose reuenge was only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for him. And without making any other discourse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:173111:92"/> hee set his Launce in the rest, seated himselfe surely in his saddle, and put himselfe in the middest of the way by which the white folke must forcibly passe, with great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and courage. And when he saw them draw neare, he said with a lowde voice: stand Sir Knight, whosoeuer you be, and render me account what you are? from whence you come? where you goe? and what that is which you carry in that beere? for according as you shew, either you haue done to others, or others to you some iniury. And it is conuenient and needfull that I know it, either to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice you for the ill you haue cōmitted, or else to reuenge you of the wrong which you haue suffered, we are in hast quoth one of the white men, and the Inne is farre off, and therefore cannot expect to giue so full relation as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and with that spurring his Mule, passed forward. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> highly disdayning at the answere, tooke by the bridle and held him, saying, stay prowde Knight, and bee better mannered another time, and giue mee account of that which I demanded, if not, I defie you all to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall battaile. The Mule whereon the white man rode was somewhat fearefull and skittish, and being taken thus rudely by the bridle, shee tooke such a fright, that rising vp on her hinder legges, shee vnhorsed her Rider; one of the Lackeyes that came with them seeing him fallen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to reuile <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who being by this through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged, without any more adoe, putting his Launce in the rest, runne vpon one of the mourners, and threw him to the ground very sore wounded: and turning vpon the rest, it was a thing worthy the noting with what dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity he did assault, breake vpon them, and put them all to flight, and it seemed none other, but that <hi>Rozinante</hi> had gotten then wings, hee bestirred himselfe so nimbly and couragiously.</p>
               <p>All those white men were fearefull people, and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and therefore fled away from the skirmish in a trice, and beganne to trauerse that field with their Tapers ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173111:93"/> that they seemed to bee maskers that vse to runne vp and downe in nights of Ioue and recreation. The mourners likewise were so lapped vp and muffled, by their mourning weedes as they could scarce stirre them, so that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did without any danger of his person giue them all the <hi>Bastonado.</hi> And caused them to forsake their roomes whether they would or no, for all of them did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thinke that he was no man but a Diuell of hell, that met them to take away the dead body which they carried in the litter. All this did <hi>Sancho</hi> behold, maruailously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at his Masters boldnes, which made him say to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, my master is infallibly as strong and valiant as he said.</p>
               <p>There lay on the ground by him whom his Mule had first ouerthrowne, a waxe Taper still burning, by whose light, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiued him, and comming ouer to him, he laid the point of his Launce vpon his face, saying, that he should render himselfe, or else he would slay him. To which the other answered, I am already rendred more then enough, seeing I cannot stirre mee out of the place, for one of my legges is broken. And if you be a Christian, I desire you not to kill mee, for therein you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a great sacriledge, I being a Licenciate, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the first Orders. Well then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> what Diuell brought thee hither being a Church-man? Who Sir replied the ouerthrowne but my misfortune? yet doth a greater threaten thee, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou doest not satisfie me in all that which I first deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee. You shall easily be satisfied, quoth the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, and therefore you shall wit, that although first of all I said I was a Licenciate, I am none, but a Batcheler, and am called <hi>Alonso Lopez,</hi> borne at <hi>Alcouendas,</hi> and I came from the Citty of <hi>Baeca,</hi> with eleuen other Priests, which are those that fled away with the Tapers; we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed towards <hi>Segonia,</hi> accompanying the dead body that lies in that litter of a certaine Gentleman who dyed in <hi>Baeca,</hi> and was there deposited for a while, and now as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173111:93"/> I say, we carry his bones to his place of buriall, which is in <hi>Segonia,</hi> the place of his birth. And who killed him, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> God, quoth the Batcheler, with certaine pestilentiall feauers that he tooke. In that manner, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> our Lord hath deliuered mee from the paines I would haue taken to reuenge his death, if any other had slaine him. But hauing kild him, he that did it, there is no other remedy but silence, and to lift vp the shoulders, for the same I must my selfe haue done, if hee were likewise pleased to slea me. And I would haue your reuercnce to vnderstand, that I am a Knight of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> called <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and mine office and exercise is to goe throughout the world righting of wrongs, and vndoing of iniuries. I cannot vnderstand how that can be of righting wrongs, quoth the Batcheler, seeing you haue made me who was right before, now very crooked by breaking of my legge, which can neuer be righted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as long as I liue, and the iniury which you haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in me, is none other but to leaue me so iniuried, as I shall remaine iniuried for euer. And it was very great disuenture to haue encountred with you, that goe about to see aduentures. All things, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceede not of one fashion: the hurt was Master Batcheler <hi>Alonso Lopez,</hi> that you trauailed thus by night couered with those Surplices, with burning Tapers, and couered with weedes of dole, so that you appeared most properly some badde thing, and of the other world, and so I could not omit to fulfill my duty, by assaulting you, which I would haue done although I verily knew you to bee the <hi>Sathans</hi> themselues of hell. For, for such I iudged and accounted you euer till now.</p>
               <p>Then since my badde fortune hath so disposed it, quoth the Batcheler; I desire you good Sir Knight errant (who hath giuen me so euill an errant) that you will helpe me to get vp from vnder this Mule, who holds still my legge betwixt the stirrop and saddle. I would haue staid talking
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173111:94"/> vntill to morrow morning, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and why did you expect so long to declare your griefe to me? he presently called to <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> to come ouer: but hee had little minde to doe, for hee was otherwise imployed, ransacking of a sumpture Mule, which those good folke brought with them, well furnished with belly ware. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> made a bagge of his Casacke, and catching all that he might, or could containe, he laid it on his beast, and then presently after repaired to his Master, and holpe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the good Batcheler from the oppression of his Mule. And mounting him againe on it, he gaue him his Taper, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> bade him to follow his fellowes, of whom he should desire pardon in his name, for the wrong hee had done them. For it lay not in his hands to haue done the contrary. <hi>Sancho</hi> said to him also, if those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen would by chance know, who the valorous Knight is, that hath vsed them thus, you may say vnto them that hee is the famous <hi>Don-Quixote of Mancha,</hi> otherwise called the Knight of the <hi>Il fauourd face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this the Batcheler departed, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded of <hi>Sancho,</hi> what had moued him to call him <hi>the Knight of the Il fauoured face,</hi> more at that time, then at any other? I will tell you that, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> I stood beholding of you a pretty while by the Taper light, which that vnlucky man carrieth, and truly you haue one of the euill-fauouredst countenances of late, that euer I saw. Which either proceedeth of your being tyred after this battaile, or else through the losse of your teeth. That is not the reason, said <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> But rather, it hath seemed fit to the wise man, to whose charge is left the writing of my History that I take some appellatiue name, as all the other Knights of yore haue done: for one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himselfe, <hi>The Knight of the burning sword.</hi> Another that <hi>of the Vnicorne,</hi> this, him <hi>of the Phoenix.</hi> The other, that <hi>of the Damzels.</hi> Another the <hi>Knight of the Griphen.</hi> And some other <hi>the Knight of Death,</hi> and by these names
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173111:94"/> and deuices, they were knowne throughout the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the earth. And so I say, that the wiseman whom I mentioned, set in thy minde and tongue the thought to cal me <hi>the Knight of the Il fauoured face,</hi> as I meane to call my selfe from hencefoorth, and that the name may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me better, I will vpon the first occasion cause to be painted in my shield, a most ill fauoured countenance. You neede not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> spend so much time and money in hauing the like countenance painted; but that which you may more easily doe, is, to discouer your owne, and looke directly on those that behold you, and I will warrant you, that without any more adoe, or new pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in your shield, they will call you, him <hi>of the Il fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red face.</hi> And let this be said in iest, that hunger and the want of your teeth, haue giuen you, as I haue said, so <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fauoured a face,</hi> as you may well excuse all other hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy portraitures. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laught at his Squires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and yet neuerthelesse he purposed to call himselfe by that name, as soone as euer he should haue commodity to paint his shield, or buckler. And after hee had paused a while, he said to <hi>Sancho,</hi> I beleeue <hi>Sancho</hi> that I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, for hauing laid violent hands vpon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated thing. <note n="*" place="margin">Canon. 72. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. 134.</note>
                  <hi>Iuxta illud: si quis suadente diabolo, &amp;c.</hi> Although I am certaine I laid not my hands vpon him, but only this Iaueline: and besides I did not any way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that I offended Priests or Church men, which I doe respect and honour as a <hi>Catholike</hi> and faithfull <hi>Christian;</hi> but rather that they were shadowes and spirits of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. And if the worst hapned, I remember well that which befell the <hi>Cid Ruy Diaz,</hi> when he broke that other Kings Embassadours chaire before the Popes holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for which he excommunicated him, and yet for all that the good <hi>Rodericke Viuar</hi> behaued himselfe that day like an honourable and valiant Knight.</p>
               <p>About this time the Batcheler departed, as is said, without speaking a word, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would faine
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:173111:95"/> haue seene whether the corps that came in the litter, was bones or no, but <hi>Sancho</hi> would not permit him, saying, Sir, you haue finished this perilous aduenture, most with your safety of any one of those I haue seene. This people although ouercome and scattered, might perhaps fall in the consideration, that he who hath ouercome them is but one person alone, and growing ashamed thereof, would perhaps ioyne and vnite themselues, and turne vpon vs, and giue vs enough businesse to doe. The Asse is in good plight according to my desire, and the mountayne at hand, and hunger oppresseth vs; therefore wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to doe at this time, but retire our selues with a good pace, and as it is said, <hi>to the graue with the dead, and let them liue to the bread.</hi> And pricking on his Asse, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested his Master to follow him, who seeing that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> spoke not without reason, he spurd after him without replying. And hauing trauailed a little way, betweene two small mountaines they found a large and hidden val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, where they alighted, and <hi>Sancho</hi> lighting his beast; and lying both along vpon the greene grasse, holpen by the sauce of hunger, they broke their fasts, dyned, ate their beauer, and supper all at one time; satisfying their appetites with more then one dish of cold meate, which the dead Gentlemans Chaplaines (which knew how to make much of themselues) had brought for their prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But here succeeded another discōmodity which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> accounted not as the least, and was, that they had no wine to drinke; no, nor as much as a droppe of water to rinse their mouthes, and being scorched with drought, <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiuing the field where they were full of thicke and greene grasse, said that which shall ensue in the Chapter following.</p>

                  <p>Of a wonderfull aduenture, atchieued with lesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, then euer any other Knight did any, by the valorous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of <hi>Mancha.</hi>

This counsell was allowed by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore leading <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the bridle, and <hi>Sancho</hi> his Asse by the halter, after laying vp the reuersion of their supper, they set on through the plaine, onely guided by their ghesse, for the night was so darke as they could not see a iot. And scarce had they trauailed two hundred paces, when they heard a great noise of water, as if it fell headlong from some great and steepe rocke. The noise did cheare them very much, and standing to heare from whence it sounded, they heard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares another noise, which watered all the continent; they conceiued before, specially in <hi>Sancho,</hi> who as I haue noted was naturally very fearefull and of little spirit. They heard I say certaine blowes strucken with proportion, with a kinde of ratling of yrons and chaines, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the furious sound of the water, might strike terrour into any other heart but <hi>Don-Quixotes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The night as we said was darke, and they hapned to enter in among certaine tall and loftie trees, whose leaues moued by a soft gale of wind, made a fearefull and still noyse. So that the solitude, situation, darknesse and the noyse of the water and trembling of the leaues, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173111:96"/> did breede horrour and affright. But specially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the blowes neuer ceased, the wind slept not, nor the morning approached; whereunto may be added that they know not the place where they were. But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> accompanied with his valiant heart, leaped on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and embracing his Buckler, brandished his Launce and said. <q>Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would haue thee know that I was borne by the disposition of heauen in this our age of iron, to refuscitate in it that of golde, or the golden world as it is called. I am hee for whom are reserued all dangerous, great, and valorous feats. I say againe that I am he which shall set vp againe those of the <hi>Round Table, the twelue peeres of Fraunce,</hi> and the <hi>nine worthies.</hi> I am he who shall cause the actes to be forgotten of those <hi>Platires, Tablantes, Oliuantes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes.</hi> The <hi>Phebusses, Beliamses,</hi> with all the crew of the famous Knights errant of times past, doing in this wherin I liue such great and wonderfull feats of armes, as shall obscure the brauest that euer they atchieued. Thou notest well faithfull and loyall Squire, the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this night, the strange silence, the deafe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused trembling of these trees, the dreadfull noyse of that water in whose search we come, which seemes to throw it selfe headlong downe from the steepe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Moone, the inceassable blowes which doth still wound our eares, all which together, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one apart, are able to strike terrour, feare, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement into the very minde of <hi>Mars,</hi> how much more in his that is not accustomed to the like chances and aduentures. Yet all this which I haue depainted to thee are inciters and rowsers of my minde, which now causeth my heart almost to burst in my breast, with the desire it hath to trie this aduenture, how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult soeuer it shewes it selfe. Wherefore tie my horse gyrts a little straighter, and farewell: here in this place thou mayest expect mee three dayes and no more. And
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173111:96"/> if I shal not returne in that space, thou mayest go backe to our village, and from thence (for my sake) to <hi>Toboso,</hi> where thou shalt say to my incomparable Lady <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> that her captiue Knight died, by attempting things that might make him worthy to be called hers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard his Lord speake these wordes, he began to weepe with the greatest compassion of the world, and say vnto him, Sir, I see no reason why you should vndertake this fearefull aduenture: it is now night, and no body can perceiue vs, wee may very well crosse the way, &amp; apart our selues from danger, although we should therefore want drinke these three dayes. And seeing none behold vs, there will be much lesse any one to take notice of our cowardize; the rather because I heard oft-times the Curate of our Village whom you know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, preach <hi>That he which seekes the danger perisheth therein;</hi> so that, it is not good to tempt God, vnderstaking such a huge affaire, out of which you cannot escape, but by miracle: and let those which heauen hath already wrought for you suffice, in deliuering you from being tost in a Couerlet, as I was, and bringing you away a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, free, and safe, from among so many enemies, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the dead man. And when all this shall not moue or soften your hard heart, let this moue it, to thinke and certainly beleeue, that scarce shall you depart from this place, when through very feare I shall giue vp my soule to him that pleaseth to take it. I left my countrey, wife, and children to come and serue you, hoping thereby to be worth more and not lesse: but as <hi>couetousnesse breakes the sacke,</hi> so hath it also torne my hopes, seeing when they were most pregnant and liuely to obtain that vnlucky and accursed Island, which you promised mee so often: I see that in exchange and pay thereof you meane to forsake mee here in a desart, out of all frequentation. For Gods sake doe not mee such a wrong my Lord; and if you will not wholy desist from your purpose, yet deferre
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:173111:97"/> it at least till the morning, for as my little skill that I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when I was a sheep-heard, telleth me, the dawning is not three houres off, <note n="*" place="margin">Porque la boca de la bozina esla lucina de la ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beca. p. 168.</note> for the mouth of the fish is ouer the head and maketh mid-night in the line of the left arme. How canst thou <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> see where is the line, or that mouth, or that taile, of which thou speakest, seeing the night is so darke that one starre alone appeareth not? that is true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but feare hath eyes, which can see things vnder the ground, and much more in the skies. And besides, we may gather by good discourse, that the day is not farre off. Let it be as little off as it lists, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> it shall neuer bee recorded of mee that either teares or prayers could euer disswade me from performing the duty of a Knight, and therefore good <hi>Sancho</hi> hold thy peace, for God who hath inspired me to attempt this vnseene and fearefull aduenture, will haue an eye to my weale, and also to comfort thy sorrow. And that thou hast therefore to doe, is to make straight my gyrts, and remaine here, for I will returne shortly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aliue or dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiuing his Lords last resolution, and how little his teares, counsailes, or prayers, could auaile, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to profit himselfe a little of his wit, and make him if hee could to expect vntill day, and so when hee did fasten the gyrts, hee softly without being felt tied his Asses hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to both <hi>Rozinantes</hi> legges so sast that when <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thought to depart he could not, for that his horse could not goe a steppe, but leaping. <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing the good successe of his guile; said, behold Sir, how heauen moued by my teares and prayers, hath ordained that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173111:97"/> his horses stay, he resolued at last to be quiet, and expect either till the morning, or else till <hi>Rozinante</hi> would please to depart, beleeuing verily that the impediment came of some other cause, and not from <hi>Sancho,</hi> and therefore said vnto him. Since it is so <hi>Sancho,</hi> that <hi>Rozinante</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stirre him, I am content to tarry till the dawning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her tardinesse cost me some teares. You shall haue no cause to weepe replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I will entertaine you telling of Histories vntill it be day, if you will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and take a nap vpon these greene hearbs, as Knights errant are wont; that you may be the fresher and better able to morrow to attempt that monstrous aduenture which you expect. What doest thou call alighting, or sleeping, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> am I peraduenture one of those Knights that repose in time of danger? sleepe thou who wast borne to sleepe, or doe what thou please, for I will doe that which I shall see fittest for my pretense. Good Sir be not angry, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I did not speake with that intention: and so drawing neare vnto him hee set one of his hands on the pomell of the saddle, and the other hinder in such sort that hee rested imbracing his Lords left thigh, not daring to depart from thence the breadth of a finger, such was the feare he had of those blowes, which all the while did sound without ceasing.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> commanded him to tell some tale to passe away the time, as he had promised, and <hi>Sancho</hi> said he would, if the feare of that which he heard would suffer him. Yet, quoth he for all this I will encourage my selfe to tell you one, whereon if I can hit aright, and that I bee not interrupted, is the best history that euer you heard, and be you attentiue for now I begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ompelleth vs to follow this, where so many feares doe surprise vs. Prosecute this tale <hi>Sancho,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and leaue the charge of the way we must goe to me. I say then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that in a village of <hi>Estremadura,</hi> there was a Sheepe-heard, I would say a Goate-heard. And as I say of my tale, this Goate-heard was called <hi>Lope Ruyz:</hi> and this <hi>Lope Ruyz</hi> was enamoured of a <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was called <hi>Torralua;</hi> the which <hi>Pastera</hi> called <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralua</hi> was Daughter to a rich heard-man, and this rich heard-man. If thou tellest thy tale <hi>Sancho</hi> after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> repeating euery thing twise that thou sayest, thou wilt not end it this two dayes. Tell it succinctly and like one of iudgement, or else say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Of the very same fashion that I tell, are all tales told in my Countrey, and I know not how to tell it any other, nor is it reason that you should aske of me to make new customes. Tell it as thou pleasest, quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> for since fortune will not otherwise, but that I must heare thee, goe forward. So that my deare Sir of my soule quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that as I haue said already, this Sheepe-heard was in loue with <hi>Torralua</hi> the <hi>Pastora,</hi> who was a round Wench, scornefull, and drew somewhat neare to a man, for shee had Mochachoes, for me thinkes I see her now before my face. Belike then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou knowest her? I did not know her, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but hee that told mee the tale, said it was so certaine and true, that I might when I told it to any other, very well sweare and affirme that I had seene it all my selfe. So that dayes passing and dayes comming, the Diuell who sleepes not, and <note n="*" place="margin">Yque todo lo annasca. Pag. 171.</note> that troubles all, wrought in such sort, as the loue that the Sheep-heard bore to the <hi>Pastora,</hi> turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man-slaughter and ill will, and the cause was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173111:98"/> to badde tongues, a certaine quantity of little iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies that shee gaue him, such as they past the line, and came to the forbidden <note n="*" place="margin">A Spanish Prouerbe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note>. And the Sheep-heard did hate her so much afterward, that hee was content to leaue all that Countrey, because hee would not see her, and goe where his eyes should neuer looke vpon her. <hi>Torralua</hi> that saw her selfe disdained by <hi>Lope,</hi> did presently loue him, better then euer shee did before: That is a naturall condition of women, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to disdaine those that loue them, and to affect those which hate them. Passe forward <hi>Sancho.</hi> It hapned, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Sheep-heard set his purpose in execution, and gathering vp his Goates, he trauailed through the fields of <hi>Estrema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dura,</hi> to passe into the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall. Torralua</hi> which knew it well followed him a foote and bare legged a farre off, with a pilgrims staffe in her hand, and a wallet hanging at her necke, where they say that shee carried a peece of a looking glasse, and another of a combe, and I know not what little bottle of changes for her face. But let her carry what shee carries, for I will not put my selfe now to verifie that. Only Ile say that they say, that the Sheep-heard arriued with his Goates to passe ouer the Riuer <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which in that season was swollen very much, and ouerflowed the banks, and at the side where hee came there was neither boate nor barke, nor any to passe himselfe or his Goates ouer the Riuer, for which he was very much grieued, because hee saw that <hi>Torralua</hi> came very neare, and shee would trouble him very much with her prayers and teares. But he went so long looking vp and downe that hee espyed a fisher who had so little a boate, as it could only hold one man and a Goate at once, and for all that hee spoke and agreed with him to passe himselfe and three hundred Goates that hee had ouer the Riuer. The fisherman entred into the boate, and carried ouer one Goate, he returned and past ouer another, and turned backe againe and past-ouer another. Keepe you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:173111:99"/> Sir good account of the Goates, that the fisherman fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ouer; for if one onely be forgotten, the tale will end, and it will not be possible to tell one word more of it. I follow on then, and I say, that the landing place on the other side was very dirty and slippery, which made the fisherman spend much time comming too and fro. Yet for all that he turned for another Goate, and another, and another.</p>
               <p>Make account, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that thou hast past them all ouer, for otherwise thou wilt not make an end of passing them in a whole yeares space. How many, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> are already past ouer? What a Diuell know I, said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> See there that which I said, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you should keepe good account. By <hi>Ioue</hi> the tale is ended therefore, for there is no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing forward. How can that be, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is it so greatly of the essence of this History to know the Goates that are past so exactly and distinctly, that if one of the number be missed, thou canst not follow on with thy tale? no Sir, in no sort, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for as soone as I demaunded of you to tell mee how many Goates past ouer, and that you answered mee you knew not, in that very instant it went from mee out of my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all that was to bee told, and yfaith it vvas of great vertue and content. So then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the tale is ended? it is as certainely ended as is my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Surely, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou hast recounted one of the rarest tales or Histories that any one of the world could thinke vpon, and that such a manner of telling or finishing a tale, was neuer yet seene or shall bee seene againe, although I neuer expected any other thing from thy good discourse. But I doe not greatly maruaile, for perhaps those senselesse strokes, haue troubled thine vnderstanding. All that may bee said <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I know in the discourse of my tale there is no more to bee said, but that there it ends,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:173111:99"/> where the errour of counting the Goates that were waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ouer the riuer begins, let it end in a good houre where it lists, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and let vs trie whether <hi>Rozinante</hi> can yet stirre himselfe, then did he turne againe to giue him the spurres, and hee to leape as he did at the first and rest anew, being vnable to doe other, hee was so well shackled.</p>
               <p>It hapned about this time, that eyther through the colde of the morning, or that <hi>Sancho</hi> had eaten at supper some lenatiue meates, or that it was a thing naturall (and that is most credible) he had a desire to doe that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could not doe for him; but such was the feare that entred into his heart, as hee dared not depart from his Lord the breadth of a straw: and to thinke to leaue that which he had desired vndone was also impossible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his resolution in that perplexed exigent, be it spoken with pardon, was this; he losed his right hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he held fast the hinderpart of the saddle, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall very softly and without any noyse hee vntled the Codpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e-point, wherewithall his breeches were onely supported, which, that being let slippe, did presently fall downe about his legges like a paire of bolts: after this, lifting vp his shirt the best he could, hee exposed his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes to the ayre, which were not the least: this being done, which as he thought was the chiefest thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to issue out of that terrible anguish and plunge; hee was suddenly troubled with a greater, to wit, that hee knew not how to disburden himselfe without making a noyse: which to auoyde first he shut his teeth close, lifted vp his shoulders, and gathered vp his breath as much he might, yet notwithstanding all these diligences, he was so vnfortunate, that he made a litle noise at the end, much different from that which made him so fearefull. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> heard it, and said, What noyse is that <hi>Sancho?</hi> I know it not Sir, quoth he, I thinke it be some new thing for aduentures, or rather disuentures neuer begin with a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173111:100"/> little. Then turned he once againe to trie his happe, and it succeeded so well that without making any rumour or noyse, but that which he did at the first, he found himselfe free of this loading that troubled him so much.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hauing the sense of smelling as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as that of his hearing; and <hi>Sancho</hi> stood so neere, or rather ioyned to him, as the vapours did ascend vpward, almost by a direct line, he could not excuse himselfe but that some of them must needs touch his nose. And scarce had they arriued but that he occurd to the vsuall remedy, and stopped it very well betweene his fingers, and then said with a snaffling voyce; Me thinkes <hi>Sancho</hi> that thou art much affraid. I am indeed, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I pray you, doe you perceiue it now more then euer? In that thou smelst now more then euer, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and that not of <hi>Ambar.</hi> It may be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> yet the fault is not mine but yours, which brings me at such vnseasonable houres, through so desolate and fearefull places. I pray thee friend retire thy selfe two or three steps back, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> holding his fingers still vpon his nose, and from henceforth haue more care of thy person, &amp; of the respect thou owest to mine; for I see the ouermuch familiarity that I vse with thee, hath ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred this contempt. I dare wager, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you thinke I haue done somewhat with my person that I ought not. Friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> it is the worse to stirre it thus. And thus in these and such like conuersation the Master and the man passed ouer the night. And <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing that the morning approached, he loosed <hi>Rozinante</hi> very warily, and tied vp his hose. <hi>Rozinante</hi> feeling himselfe (although he was not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very couragious) hee seemed to reioyce, and began to beate the ground with his hooffes; for by his leaue hee could neuer yet curuet. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing that <hi>Rozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> could now stirre, accounted it to be a good signe, and an incouragement of him to attempt that timorous aduenture.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:173111:100"/>
               <p>By this <hi>Aurora</hi> did display her purple mantell ouer the face of Heauen, and euery thing appeared distinctly, which made <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiue that he was among a number of tall Chesnut-trees, which commonly make a great shadow. He heard likewise those incessable strokes, but could not espy the cause of thē; wherfore giuing <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> presently the spurre, and turning backe again to <hi>Sancho</hi> to bid him farewell, he commaunded him to stay for him there three dayes at the longest, and that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not after that space, he should make full account, that Ioue was pleased he should end his daies in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous aduenture. He repeated to him againe the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage and errant hee should carrie in his behalfe to his Ladie <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> &amp; that touching the reward of his serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he should not feare any thing, for he had left his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made before he departed from his village, where he should finde himselfe gratified, touching all that which pertained to his hire, according to the rate of the time he had serued. But if God would bring him off, from that aduenture safe and sound, and without danger, he might full account to receiue the promised Island. Here <hi>Sancho</hi> began anew to weepe, hearing againe the pittifull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of his good Lord, and determined not to abandon him vntill the last traunce and end of that affaire, and out of these teares and honourable resolution of <hi>Sancho,</hi> the authour of this History collects, that it is like he was well borne, or at the very least an olde <hi>Christian,</hi> whose griefe did moue his Master a little, but not so much as he should shew the least argument of weakenes, but rather dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it the best that he could, he followed on his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the way of the water, and that where the stroakes were heard. <hi>Sancho</hi> followed him a foote, leading as he was wont, his Asse by the halter, who was the insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fellow of his prosperous or aduerse fortunes.</p>
               <p>And hauing trauelled a good space among those Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut and shady trees, they came out into a little plaine that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:173111:101"/> stood at the foot of certaine steepe rockes, from whose tops did precipitate it selfe a great fall of water. There were at the foot of those rockes certaine houses, so ill made, as they rather seemed ruines of buildings then houses; from whence as they perceiued, did issue the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rumour and noyse of the stroakes, which yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Rozinante</hi> at this dreadfull noyse did start, and being made quiet by his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> did by little and little draw neere to the houses, recommending himselfe on the way most deuoutly to his Ladie <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and also to <hi>Ioue,</hi> desiring him that he would not forget him. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> neuer departed from his Lords side, and stretched out his necke and eyes as farre as he might through <hi>Rozinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> his legges, to see if he could perceiue that which helde him so fearefull and suspended. And after they had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled about a hundred paces, more at the dubling of a point of a mountaine they saw the very cause, patent and open (for rhere could be none other) of that so hideous and fearefull a noyse that had kept them all the night so doubtfull and affrighted, and was (O Reader if thou wilt not take it in bad part) sixe yron Maces that fulled cloath, which with their interchangeable blowes, did forme that maruellous noyse.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw what it was, he waxed mute and all ashamed. <hi>Sancho</hi> beheld him, and saw that hee hanged his head on his breast with tokens that hee was somewhat ashamed. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> looked also on his Squire, and saw that his cheekes were swolne with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, giuing withall euident signes that he was in danger to burst, if he did not permit that violent passion to make a sally, whereat all <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> melancholy little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, he could not beholding <hi>Sancho,</hi> but laugh also himselfe. And when <hi>Sancho</hi> saw that his Master had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the play, he let slip the prisoner in such violent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to presse his sides hardly with both his hands to saue himselfe from bursting. Foure times he ended, and other
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:173111:101"/> foure he renued his laughter with as great impulse and force as at the first, whereat <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inraged, but chiefly hearing him say in gibing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I would haue thee know friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I was born by the disposition of heauen in this our age of yron, to renue in it that of gold or the golden world. I am hee for whom are reserued all dangerous, great, and valorous feats. And in this sort he went repeating all or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the words, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had said the first time that they heard the timorous blowes, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that <hi>Sancho</hi> mockt him, grew so ashamed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry withall, that lifting vp the end of his launce, he gaue him two such blowes on the backe, as if he had receiued them on his pate, would haue freed his Master from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any wages, if it were not to his hayres. <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing that he gained so ill earnest by his iests, fearing that his Master should goe onward with it, he said vnto him with very great submission; Pacifie your selfe good Sir, for by <hi>Ioue</hi> I did but iest. But why dost thou iest? I tell thee, I doe not iest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Come here Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Merriman, thinkest thou that as those are yron Maces to full cloth, they were some other dangerous aduenture, that I haue not shown resolution enough to vndertake &amp; finish it? Am I by chance obliged being as I am a Knight to know &amp; distinguish noyses, and perceiue which are of a fulling Mill or no? And more it might (as it is true) that I neuer saw any before as thou hast done, base villain that thou art, borne and brought vp among the like: if not, make thou that these sixe Maces be conuerted into sixe Giants, and cast them in my beard one by one, or all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and when I doe not turne all their heeles vp, then mocke me as much as thou pleasest.</p>
               <p>No more good Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I confesse I haue beene somewhat too laughsome. But tell me I pray you, now that we are in peace, as God shall deliuer you out of all aduentures that may befall you as whole and sound, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173111:102"/> he hath done out of this, hath not the great feare we were in, beene a good subiect of laughter, and a thing worthy the telling? At least I, for of you I am certaine that you doe not yet know what feare or terror is. I doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but that which befell vs is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of laughter: yet ought it not to be recounted, for as much as all persons are not so discreete, as to know how to discerne one thing from another, and set euery thing in his right point. You know at least wise, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> how to set your Iaueline in his point, when pointing at my pate, you hit me on the shoulders, thanks be to God, and to the diligence I put in going aside. But farewell it, for all will away in the bucking; and I haue heard olde folke say, That man loues thee well, who makes thee to weepe: and besides great Lords are wont after a badde word which they say to one of their Seruingmen, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on him presently a paire of hose. But I know not yet what they are wont to giue them after blowes, if it be not that Knights errant giue after the bastanado Islands, or Kingdomes on the continent. The Die might runne so fauourably, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as all thou hast said, might come to passe: and therefore pardon what is done since thou art discreete, and knowest that a mans first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not in his hand. And be aduertised of one thing from hence forward (to the end to abstaine, and carry thy selfe more respectiuely in thy ouer-much liberty of speech with mee) that in as many bookes of Chiualry as I haue read, which are infinite, I neuer found that any Squire spoke so much with his Lord, as thou dost with thine; which in good sooth I do attribute to thy great indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mine, thine in respecting me so little, mine in not making my selfe to be more regarded. Was not <hi>Gandalin Amadis du Gaules</hi> Squire Earle of the <hi>firme Island?</hi> and yet it is read of him that hee spoke to his Lord with his Cap in his hand, his head bowed, and his body bended <hi>(more Turcesco).</hi> What then shall we say of <hi>Gasabel Don
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:173111:102"/> Gataors</hi> Squire, who was so silent, as to declare vs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie thereof, his name is but once repeated in all that so great and authenticall a History? Of all which my wordes, <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou must inferre, that thou must make difference betweene the Master and the man, the Lord and his Seruingman, the Knight and his Squire. So that from this day forward we must proceede with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, not letting the clew runne so much, for after what way soeuer I grow angry with thee, it will be badde for the Pitcher. The rewards and benefites that I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised thee, will come in their time, and if they doe not, thy wages cannot be lost (as I haue already said to thee).</p>
               <p>You say very well quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but faine would I learne (in case that the time of rewards came not, and that I must of necessity trust to my wages) how much a Knight errants Squire did gain in times past? Or if they did agree for moneths or by dayes as Masons men. I doe not thinke quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that they went by the hire, but onely trusted to their Lords curtesie. And if I haue assigned wages to thee in my sealed Testament which I left at home, it was to preuent the worst, because I know not yet what successe <hi>Chinalrie</hi> may haue in these our so miserable times, and I would not haue my soule suffer in the other world for such a minuity as is thy wages. For thou must vnderstand that in this world there is no state so dangerous as that of Knights errant. That is most true replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing the onely sound of the Maces of a fulling Mill, could trouble and disquiet the heart of so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant a Knight as you are. But you may be sure that I will not hereafter once vnfolde my lips to iest at your doings, but onely to honour you as my Master and naturall Lord. By doing so, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou shalt liue on the face of the earth, for next to our parents we are bound to respect our Masters, as if they were our fathers.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the high aduenture and rich winning of the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> with other successes befalne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible Knight.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T began about this time to raine, and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> would faine haue entred into the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mils, but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had conceiued such hate against them for the iest recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as he would in no wise come neere them, but turning his way on the right hand, he fell into a high way, as much beaten as that wherein they rode the day before; within a while after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> espied one a horsebacke, that bore on his head somewhat that glistred like gold; and scarce had he seene him, when hee turned to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and said, Me thinks <hi>Sancho</hi> that there's no prouerbe that is not true, for they are all sentences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of experience it selfe, which is the vniuersall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of sciences; and specially that prouerbe that sayes, <hi>Where one doore is shut another is opened.</hi> I say this, because if fortune did shut yesternight the doore that we searched deceiuing vs in the aduenture of the yron Maces, it layes vs now wide open the doore that may addresse vs to a better and more certaine aduenture, whereon if I cannot make a good entry, the fall shall be mine, without being able to attribute it to the little knowledge of the fulling Maces, or the darkenesse of the night: which I affirme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if I be not deceiued, there comes one towards vs, that weares on his head the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> for which I made the oath. See well what you say Sir, and better what you doe, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I would not wish that this were new Maces to batter vs and our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The Diuell take thee for a man, replied <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> what difference is there betwixt a helmet and fulling
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:173111:103"/> Maces? I know not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but if I could speake as much now as I was wont, perhaps I would giue you such reasons as you your selfe should see how much you are deceiued in that you speake. How may I be deceiued in that I say scrupulous traytor, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Tell mee, seest thou not that Knight which comes riding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs on a dapple gray horse, with a helmet of golde on his head? That which I see and finde out to be so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Sancho,</hi> is none other then a man on a gray Asse like mine owne, and brings on his head somewhat that shines. Why that is <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> stand aside and leaue me alone with him, thou shalt see how without speech to cut of delayes, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this aduenture and remain with the helmet as mine owne which I haue desired so much, I will haue care to stand off, but I turne againe to say, that I pray God, that it be a purchase of gold and not fulling Mils. I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said to thee, that thou doe not make any more menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no not in thought of those Maces; for if thou dost said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> I vow, I say no more, that I will batter thy soule. Hereat <hi>Sancho</hi> fearing lest his Master would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the vow which he had throwne out as round as a bowle, held his peace.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the truth of the History of the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, horse and Knight which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw: There was in that Commarke two villages, the one so little as it had neyther shop nor Barber, but the greater that was neere vnto it was furnished of one, and he therefore did serue the little village when they had any occasion, as now it befell that therein lay one sicke and must bee let bloud, and another that desired to trimme his beard; for which purpose the Barber came, bringing with him a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Bason: and as hee trauelled, it by chance began to raine, and therefore clapt his Bason on his head to saue his hatte from stayning, because it belike was a new one. And the Bason being cleane skowred, glistred halfe a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:173111:104"/> league off. He rode on a gray Asse as <hi>Sancho</hi> said; and that was the reason why <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke them to be a dapple gray Steede, a Knight and a helmet of gold; for he did with all facility apply euery thing which he saw to his rauing Chiualry and ill-errant thoughts. And when he saw that the poore Knight drew neere, without setling himselfe to commune with him, he inrested his <note n="*" place="margin">Sancon.</note> Iaueline low on the thigh, and ranne with all the force <hi>Rozinante</hi> might, thinking to strike him thorow and thorow. And drawing neere vnto him, without stopping his horse, hee cryed, defend thy selfe Caytise, or else render vnto mee willingly, that which is my due by all reason. The Barber who so without fearing or surmising any such thing, saw that Fantasiue and spirit come vpon him, had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to auoyde the blow of the Launce but to fall off of his Asse to the ground: and scarce had hee touched the earth, when rising vp againe as light as a Deere, he runne away so swistly through the plaine, as the winde could scarce ouertake him; leauing behinde him on the ground his Bason, wherewithall <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested content, and said, that <hi>Pagan</hi> which lost it was discreete, and did imitate the <hi>Castor,</hi> who seeing himselfe hotly pursued by the hunters, which teares and cuts away that with his teeth, for which he knows by naturall instinct he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then he commaunded <hi>Sancho</hi> to take vp the helmet, who lifting it, said the Bason is a good one By God, and is as well worth a Riall of eight as a marnedie; and giuing it to his Lord, he presently set it on his head, turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout euery way, to see whether he could get the Beauer, and seeing he could not finde it, hee said, The <hi>Pagan</hi> for whom this famous helmet was first forged, had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly a very great head; and that which grieues me prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally is, that this helmet wants the one halfe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> heard him call the Bason a helmet, hee could not containe his laughter, but presently remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring on his Masters choler, he checkt it in the midst. Why
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173111:104"/> dost thou laugh <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> I laugh, said he, to thinke on the great head the <hi>Pagan</hi> owner of this helmet had. For it is for all the world like a Barbers Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Know <hi>Sancho</hi> that I imagine, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that this famous piece of this inchanted helmet did fall by some strange accident into some ones handes that knew not the worth thereof, and seeing it was of pure gold, without knowing what lie did, I thinke hee hath moulten the halfe, to profite himselfe therewithall, and made of the other halfe this which seemes a Barbers Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as thou sayest. But be what it list, to me who knowes well what it is his transmutation makes no matter, for I will dresse it so in the first towne, where I shall finde a Smith, as that which the God of forges made for the God of warre, shall not surpasse, no nor come neere it; and in the meane while I will weare it as I may: for something is better then nothing; and more, seeing it may very well defend me from the blow of a stone. That's true, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if it be not throwne out of a sling, such as that of the battell of the two armies, when they blissed your Worships checke teeth, and broke the bottle wherin you carried the most blissed drench which made me vomit vp my guts. I doe not much care for the losse of it <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for as thou knowest, I haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in memory; so haue I likewise, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but if euer I make it or taste it again in my life, I pray God that here may be mine end. How much more I neuer meane to thrust my selfe into any occasion wherin I should haue neede of it; for I meane with all my fiue senses to keepe my selfe from hurting any, or being hurt. Of being once againe tost in a Couerlet I say nothing, for such disgraces can hardly be preuented, and if they befall, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy but patience, and to lift vp the shoulders, keepe in the breath, shut the eyes, and suffer our selues to bee borne where Fortune and the Couerlet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:173111:105"/>
               <p>Thou art a badde Christian <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> hearing him say so; for thou neuer forgettest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries that are once done to thee: know that it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of noble and generous minds not to make any account of toyes. What legge hast thou brought away lame, what ribbe broken, or what head hurte, that thou canst not yet forget that jest? for the thing being well examined, it was none other then a jest or pastime; for if I did not take it to be such, I had returned by this to that place, &amp; done more harme in thy reuenge, then that which the <hi>Greekes</hi> did for the rape of <hi>Helen:</hi> who if she were in these times, or my <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in hers, she might be sure she should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue gained so much fame for beauty as she did: and saying so, he pierced the skie with a sigh. Then said <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> let it passe for a jest, since the reuenge cannot passe in earnest. But I know well the quality both of the jests and earnest, and also that they shall neuer fall out of my memory, as they will neuer out of my shoulders. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this apart, what shall we doe with this dapple gray Steed that lookes so like a gray Asse, which that <hi>Martin</hi> left behinde, whom you ouerthrew, who according as he laide feete on the dust and made hast, hee mindes not to backe for him againe, and by my beard the gray beast is a good one. I am not accustomed, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to ransacke and spoyle those whom I ouercome, nor is it the practise of Chiualry to take their horses, and let them goe a foote: if that it befall the Victor to lose in the conflict his owne; for in such a case it is lawfull to take that of the vanquished, as wonne in faire warre. So that <hi>Sancho</hi> leaue that horse, or Asse, or what else thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest to call it, for when his owner sees vs departed, he will returne againe for it. God knowes, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be good or no for me to take him, or at least change for mine owne, which me thinkes is not so good. Truely the lawes of Knighthood are straight, since they extend not themselues to licence the exchang of one Asse
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:173111:105"/> for another: and I would know whether they permit at least to change the one harnesse for another. In that I am not very sure, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and as a case of doubt (vntill I be better informed) I say that thou exchange them, if by chance thy neede bee extreme: so extreme, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that if they were for mine owne very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I could not neede them more. And presently enabled by the licence, he made <hi>mutatio Caparum,</hi> and set forth his beast like a hundred holy-dayes.</p>
               <p>This being done, they broke their fast with the relickes of the spoyles they had made in the Campe of Sumpture horse, and drunke of the Milles streames, without once turning to looke on them (so much they abhord them for the maruellous terror they had strucken them in) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by their repast cut away all cholericke and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke humours, they followed on the way which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante</hi> pleased to leade them (who was the depository of his Masters will, and also of the Asses, who followed him alwayes wheresoeuer hee went in good amitie and company. For all this they returned to the high way, wherein they trauelled at randome, without any certaine deliberation which way to goe. And as they thus trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Sancho</hi> said to his Lord, Sir, will you giue me leaue to commune a little with you; for since you haue imposed vpon me that sharpe commaundement of silence more then foure things haue rotted in my stomacke, and one thing that I haue now vpon the tippe of my tongue, I would not wish for any thing that it should miscarry? Say it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and be briefe in thy reasons, <hi>For none is delightfull if it be prolix.</hi> I say then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I haue beene these later dayes, considering how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is gained by following these aduentures, that you doe thorow these desarts and crosse waies, where though you ouercome and finish the most dangerous, yet no man sees nor knowes them, and so they shall remaine in perpetu all silence, both to your preiudice, and that of the fame
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173111:106"/> which they deserue. And therefore me thinkes it were better (still excepting your better iudgement herein) that we went to serue some Emperour, or other great Prince that maketh warre, in whose seruice you might show the valour of your person, your maruellous force, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull iudgement: which being perceiued by the Lord whom we shall serue, he must perforce reward vs, euery one according to his deserts; and in such a place will not want one to record your noble acts for a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: of mine I say nothing, seeing they must not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the Squire-like limits: although I dare auouch that if any notice be taken in Chiualry of the feats of Squires, mine shall not fall away betwixt the lines.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Sancho</hi> thou sayest not ill, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but before such a thing come to passe, it is requisite to spend some time vp and downe the world, as in probation, seeking of aduentures, to the end that by atchieuing some, a man may acquire such fame and renoune, as when he goes to the Court of any great Monark, he be there already knowne by his workes, and that he shall scarcely be perceiued to enter at the gates by the boyes of that Citie, when they all will follow &amp; inuiron him, crying out aloude; This is the Knight of the Sunne, or the Serpent, or of some other deuice vnder which hee hath atchieued strange aduentures. This is he (will they say) who ouercame in single fight the huge Giant <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabruno</hi> of the inuincible strength.

So that they will thus goe proclayming his actes from hand to hand; and presently the King of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, moued by the great bruit of the boyes and other people, will stand at the windowes of his Palace to see what it is; and as soone as hee shall eye the Knight, knowing him by his armes, or by the <hi>Impresa</hi> of his shield, he must necessarily say, vp, goe all of you my
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:173111:106"/> Knights, as many of you as are in my Court forth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the flower of Chiualry, which comes there: at whose commandement they all wil sally, &amp; he himselfe will come downe to the midst of the staires, and will embrace him most straightly, and will giue him the peace, kissing him on the cheeke: and presently will carrie him by the hand to the Queenes chamber, where the Knight shall finde her accompanied by the Princesse her daughter, which must be one of the fairest and debonaire damzels that can be found throughout the vast compasse of the earth; after this will presently and in a trice succeed that she will cast her eye on the Knight, and he on her, and each of them shall seeme to the other no humane creature but an Angell, and then without knowing how, or how not, they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine captiue and intangled in the intricable amorous nette, and with great care in their mindes, because they know not how they shall speake to discouer their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and feeling. From thence the King will carrie him without doubt to some quarter of his Palace richly hanged; where hauing taken off his armes, they will bring him a rich mantell of Scarlet, furred with ermines to weare: and if hee seemed well before being armed, he shall now looke as well or better out of them. The night being come, he shal sup with the King, Queene &amp; Princesse, where he shal neuer take off his eye off her, beholding vnawares of those that stand present: &amp; she will do the like with as much discretion; for as I haue said she is a very discreete damzell. The Tables shall be taken vp, there shall enter vnexpectly in at the hal an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Presently the King wil com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand al those that are present to proue it, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> they do
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:173111:107"/>none of them can finish it, but onely the new come Knight to the great proofe of his fame. Whereat the Princesse will remaine very glad, and will be very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and well appaide, because fhee hath setled her thoughts in so high a place. And the best of it is that this King, or Prince, or what else he is, hath a very great warre with another as mighty as hee; and the Knight his guest doth aske him (after he hath bin in the Court a few dayes) licence to go and serue him in that warre. The King will giue it with a very good will, and the Knight will kisse his handes courteously for the fauour he doth him therein: and that night he will take leaue of his Ladie the Princesse by some window of a garden that lookes into her bed-chamber; by the which hee hath spoken to her oft-times before, being a great meanes and helpe therto, a certaine damzell which the Princesse trusts very much. He sighes, and shee will fall in a sound, and the damzell will bring water, to bring her to her selfe againe. She will be also full of care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the morning drawes neere, and she would not haue them discouered for any her Ladies honour. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Princesse will returne to her selfe, and will giue out her beautifull handes at the window to the Knight, who will kisse them a thousand and a thousand times, and will bathe them all in teares. There it will remaine agreed betweene them two, the meanes that they will vse to acquaint one another with their good or badde successes; and the Princes will pray him to stay a way as little time as he may, which he shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto her, with many oathes and protestations. Then will he turne againe to kisse her handes, and take his leaue of her with such feeling, that there will want but litle to end his life in the place he goes from thence to his chamber, and casts himselfe vpon his bedde, but he shall not be able to sleepe a nappe for sorrow of his departure: he will after get vp very early, and will goe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:173111:107"/> to take leaue of the King, the Queene and Princesse. They tell him (hauing taken leaue of the first two) that the Princesse is ill at ease, and that she cannot be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the Knight thinkes that it is for griefe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and the which tidings launceth him anew to the bottom of his heart, wherby he will be almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to giue manifest tokens of his griefe: the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel that is priuy to their loues will be present, and must note all that passeth, and goe after to tell it to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, who receiues her with teares, and sayes vnto her that one of the greatest afflictions she hath is, that she does not know who is her Knight, or whether hee be of blood royall or no: Her damzell will assure her againe that so great bountie, beauty and valor as is in her Knight, could not find place but in a great &amp; royall subiect. The carefull Princesse will comfort her selfe with this hope; and labour to bee cheerefull lest shee should giue occasion to her parents to suspect any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thing of her: and within two dayes againe she will come out in publique. By this the Knight is departed, he fights in the warre, and ouercomes the Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he winnes many Cities, and triumphes for many battels, he returnes to the Court, he visits his Lady, and speakes to her at the accustomed place, he agreeth with her to demaund her of the King for his wife, in reward of his seruices, whereunto the King will not consent, because he knowes not what he is: but for all this, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by carrying her away, or by some other maner the Princesse becomes his wife, and he accounts himselfe therefore very fortunate, because it was after knowne that the same Knight is sonne to a very valorous King of I know not what Countrey; for I beleeue it is not in all the Mappe. The father dies, and the Princesse doth inherite the Kingdome, and thus in two wordes our Knight is become a King. Heere in this place enters presently the commoditie to reward his Squire, and all
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:173111:108"/> those that holpe him to ascend to so high an estate. He marries his Squire with one of the Princesses damzels, which shall doubtlesly bee the very same that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his loue, who is some principall Dukes daughter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That's it I seeke for, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and all will goe right; therefore I will leane to that, for euery whit of it which you said will happen to your selfe, without missing a iot, calling your selfe <hi>The Knight of the ill fauoured face.</hi> Neuer doubt it <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for euen in the very same maner, and by the same steppes that I haue recounted here Knights errant doe ascend and haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sended to be Kings and Emperours. This only is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that we enquire what King among the Christians or Heathens makes warre and hath a faire daughter: but we shall haue time enough to bethinke that, since as I haue said we must first acquire fame in other places, before we goe to the Court. Also I want another thing, that put case that we find a Christian or Pagan King, that hath warres and a faire daughter, and that I haue gained incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible fame throughout the wide-world, yet cannot I tell how I might finde that I am descended from Kings, or at the least cousen Germaine remoued of an Emperour? For the King will not giue me his daughter, vntill this be first very well proued, though my workes deserue it neuer so much; so that I feare to lose through this defect, that which mine owne hath merited so well. True it is, that I am a Gentleman of a knowne house of propriety and possession; and perhaps the wise man that shall write my History will so beautifie my kindred and discent, that hee will find me to be the fift or sixt descent from a King; for thou must vnderstand <hi>Sancho,</hi> that there are two maners of lineages in the world. Some that deriue their pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from Princes and Monarkes, whom time hath by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little diminished and confumed, and ended in a point like <hi>Pyramydes.</hi> Others that tooke their beginning
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:173111:108"/> from base people, and ascend from degree vnto degree, vntill they become at last great Lords. So that all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that some were that which they are not now, and others are that which they were not. And it might be that I am of those, and after good examination my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning might be found to haue beene famous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; wherewithall the King my father in law ought to be content, whosoeuer he were: and when he were not, yet shall the Princesse loue me in such sort, that she shall in despite of her fathers teeth, admit me for her Lord and Spouse, although she knew me to be the sonne of a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bearer. And if not, here in this place may quader well, the carrying of her away perforce, and carrying of her where best I liked; for eyther time or death must needes end her fathers displeasure.</p>
               <p>Here comes well to passe that <hi>Sancho,</hi> which some damned fellowes are wont to say; <hi>Seeke not to get that with a good will, which thou mayest take perforce;</hi> although it were better said, <hi>The leape of a shrubbe is more worth then good mens intreaties.</hi> I say it to this purpose, that if the King your father in law will not condiscend to giue vnto you the Princesse my Mistresse, then there's no more to be done, but as you say to her, steale away &amp; carie her to another place: but all the harme is, that in the meane while that composition is vnmade, and you possesse not quietly your Kingdome, the poore Squire may whistle for any benefite or pleasure you are able to doe him, if it be not that the damzell of whom you spoke euen now, runne away with her Ladie, and that he passe away his misfortunes now and then with her, vntil heauen ordaine some other thing: for I doe thinke that his Lord may giue her vnto him presently, if he please to be his lawfull Spouse. There's none that can depriue thee of that, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Why, so that this may befall, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> there's no more but to commend our selues to God, and let fortune runne where it may best addresse vs. God
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:173111:109"/> bring it so to passe, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as I desire, and thou hast neede of <hi>Sancho?</hi> and let him be a wretch that accounts himselfe one. Let him be so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am an olde Christian; and to be an Earle there is no more requisite. I, and tis more then enough, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> for that purpose: and though thou werest not, it made not much matter; for I being a King I may giue thee nobility, without eyther buying of it, or seruing me with nothing. For in creating thee an Earle, loe thereby thou art a Gentleman: and let men say what they please, they must in good faith call thee right honourable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it grieue them neuer so much. And thinke you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that I would not authorize my <hi>Litado.</hi> Thou must say <hi>Dictado</hi> or dignity, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and not <hi>Litado,</hi> for that's a barbarous word. Let it be so, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> I say that I would accommodate all very well, for I was once by my life: the warner of a <hi>Confratriety,</hi> and the warners gowne became me so well, that euery one said I had a presence fit for the prouost of the same. Then how much more when I shall set on my shoulders the Reall of a Duke, or be apparrelled with golde and pearles after the custome of strange Earles; I doe verily beleeue that men will come a hundred leagues to see me. Thou wilt seeme very well, quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> but thou must shaue that beard very often, for as thou hast it now so bushie, knit, and vnhandsome, if thou shauest it not with a razor at the least euery other day, men will know that thou art as farre from Gentilitie as a Musket can carie. What more is there to be done, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> then to take a Barber, and keepe him hired in my house; yea, and if it be necessary, he shall ride after me, as if he were a Master of horse to some Nobleman: how knowest thou, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that Noblemen haue their Masters of horses riding after them? Some few years agoe I was a moneth in the Court, and there I saw that as a young little Lord rode by for his pleasure, they said
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:173111:109"/> he was a great <hi>Grande:</hi> there followed him still a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe a certaine man turning euery way that he went, so as he verily seemed to be his horse taile. I then demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cause why that man did not ride by the others side, but still did follow him so? They answered me that he was Master of his horses, and that the <hi>Grandes</hi> were accustomed to carrie such men after them. Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and thou mayest carry thy Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in that manner after thee; for <hi>customes came not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> nor were not inuented at once. And thou mayest be the first Earle that carried his Barber after him. And I doe assure thee that it is an office of more trust to trim a mans beard then to saddle a horse. Let that of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber rest to my charge, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and that of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be a King, and of creating me an Earle to yours. It shall be so, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> and thus lifting vp his eyes, he saw that which shall be recounted in the chapter following.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ide Hamete Benengeli,</hi> an <hi>Arabicall</hi> and <hi>Machegan</hi> Author recounts in this most graue, lofty, diuine, sweet, conceited Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, that after these discourses past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Panca,</hi> which we haue laid downe in the last Chapter. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> lifting vp his eyes, saw that there came in the very same way wherein they rode, about some twelue men in a company on foote, inserted like Bead-stones in a great chaine of yron that was tyed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:173111:110"/> about their neckes, and euery one of them had manacles besides on their handes. There came to conduct them two on horsebacke, and two others a foot; the horsemen had firelocke pieces, those that came a foote darts and swords. And as soone as <hi>Sancho</hi> saw them, he said; This is a chaine of Gally-slaues, people forced by the King to go to the Gallies. How? people forced, demanded <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is it possible that the King will force any body? I say not so, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that it is people which are condemned for their offences to serue the King in the Gallies perforce. In resolution, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> (howsoeuer it be) this folke, although they be conducted goe perforce, and not willingly. That's so, quoth <hi>Sancho.</hi> Then if that be so, here fals in iustly the execution of my function, to wit, the dissoluing of violences and outrages, and the succouring of the afflicted and needefull. I pray you Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> to consider that the Iustice, who represents the King himselfe, doth wrong or violence to no body, but onely doth chastice them for their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted crimes.</p>
               <p>By this the chaine of slaues arriued, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with very courteous termes requested those that went in their guard, that they would please to informe him of the cause wherefore they carried that people away in that manner? One of the guardians a horse-backe answered, that they were slaues condemned by his Maiestie to the Gallies, and there was no more to be said, neither ought he to desire any farther knowledge. For all that, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I would faine learne of euery one of them in particular the cause of his disgrace: and to this did adde other such and so courteous wordes, to moue them to tell him what he desired, as the other guardian a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe said. Although we carie here the Register and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the condemnations of euery one of these wretches, yet this is no time to hold them here long, or take out the processes to reade, draw you neerer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:173111:110"/> it of themselues, for they may tel it and they please, and I know they will; for they are men that take delight both in acting and relating knaueries.</p>
               <p>With this licence, which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himselfe would haue taken, although they had not giuen it him, he came to the chaine, and demanded of the first for what offence he went in so ill a guise? Hee answered that his offence was no other then for being in loue; for which cause on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he went in that manner. For that and no more, replied <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Well, if enamoured folke be cast into the Gallies, I might haue beene rowing there a good many dayes agoe. My loue was not such as you coniecture, quoth the slaue, for mine was that I loued so much a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket well heaped with fine linnen, as I did embrace it so straightly, that if the Iustice had not taken it away from me by force, I would not haue forsaken it to this houre by my good will. All was done in <hi>Flagrante,</hi> there was no leisure to giue me torment, the cause was concluded, my shoulders accommodated with a hundred, and for a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement three prices of <hi>Garrupes,</hi> and the worke was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. What are <hi>Garrupes,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote? Garrupes</hi> are Gallies, replied the slaue, who was a young man of some foure and twenty yeares old, and said he was borne in <hi>Piedrahita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded of the second his cause of offence, who would answere nothing he went so sad and melancholy. But the first answered for him, and said, Sir this man goes for a <hi>Canarie bird,</hi> I meane for a Musitian and Singer. Is it possible, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians and Singers are likewise sent to the Gallies? Yes Sir, quoth the slaue, for there's nothing worse then to sing in anguish. Rather, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I haue heard say that he <hi>which sings doth affright and chase away his harms.</hi> Here it is quite contrary, quoth the slaue, for <hi>He that sings once, weepes all his life after.</hi> I doe not vnderstand it, said <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> but one of the guardians said to him, Sir
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:173111:111"/> Knight, to <hi>sing in anguish,</hi> is said among this people <hi>non Sancta,</hi> to confesse vpon the racke. They gaue this poore wretch the torture, and he confessed his delight that hee was a <hi>Quartrezo,</hi> that is a stealer of beastes. And because he hath confessed, he is likewise condemned to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for sixe years, with an <hi>Amen</hi> of two hundred blowes, which he beares already with him on his shoulders; and he goes alwayes thus sad and pensatiue, because the other theeues that remaine behinde, and also those which goe heere doe abuse, despise, and scorne him for confessing, and not hauing a courage to say <hi>Non.</hi> For they say a <hi>No,</hi> hath as many letters as an <hi>Ye,</hi> &amp; that a delinquent is very fortunate, when his life or his death onely depends of his owne tongue, and not of witnesses or proofes: and in mine opinion they haue very great reason. I likewise thinke the same, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And passing to the third, he demaunded that which he had done of the rest, who answered him out of hand, and that pleasantly. I goe to the Lady <hi>Garrupes</hi> for fiue yeares because I wanted tenne Duccats. I will giue twenty with all my heart to free thee from that misfortune, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> That, quoth the slaue, would be like to one that hath money in the midst of the Gulfe, and yet dies for hunger, because he can get no meat to buy for it. I say this, because if I had those twenty Duckets which your Worships liberality offers me in due season, I would haue so annoynted with them the Notaries penne, and whetted my Lawyers wit so well, that I might to day see my selfe in the midst of the Market of <hi>Cocodouer</hi> of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and not in this way trayled thus like a Grey-hound: but God is great. Patience; and this is enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> went after to the fourth, who was a man of a venerable presence, with a long white beard which reached to his bosome. Who hearing himselfe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cause why he came there, began to weepe, and answered not a word. But the fift flaue lent him a tongue,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:173111:111"/> and said, This honest man goes to the Gallies for foure yeares, after he had walked the Ordinary apparrelled in pompe, and a horsebacke. That is, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as I take, after he was caried about to the shame and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view of the people. You are in the right, quoth the slaue, and the crime for which hee is condemned to this paine, was, for being a Broker of the eare, I and of all the body too; for in effect I meane that this Gentleman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for a Baude, and likewise for hauing a little smacke and entrance in witch-craft. If that smacke and insight in witchcraft were not added, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hee merited not to goe and row in the Gallies for being a pure Baude, but rather deserued to gouerne and be their Generall. For the office of a Baude is not like euery other ordinary office, but rather of great discretion and most necessary in any Common-wealth well gouerned, and should not be practised but by people well borne; and ought besides to haue a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Veedor</hi> is an office in Spaine of great trust, set by the King to examine and search the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-officers, an Ouersecr or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler.</note>
                  <hi>Veedor,</hi> and examinator of them, as are of al other trades, &amp; a certain appointed number of men known, as are of the other brokers of the exchange. And in this manner many harmes that are done might be excused, because this trade and office is practised by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreete people of little vnderstanding; such as are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of little more or lesse, young Pages and Iesters of few yeares standing, and of lesse experience, which in the most vrgent occasions, and when they should contriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing artificially, the crummes freeze in their mouthes and fists, and they know not which is their right hand. Faine would I passe forward, and giue reasons why it is conuenient to make choise of those which ought in the Common-wealth to practise this so necessary an office: but the place and season is not fit for it. One day I will say it to those which may prouide and remedy it: onely I say now, that the assumpt or addition of a Witch, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued me of the compassion I should otherwise haue, to see those gray haires and venerable face in such distresse
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:173111:112"/> for being a Baude. Although I know very well that no sorcery in the world can moue or force the will, as some ignorant persons thinke (for our will is a free power, and ther's no hearb nor charme can constrain it.) That which certain simple women, or cousening companions make, are some mixtures and poysons, wherewithall they cause men runne madde, and in the meane while perswade vs that they haue force to make one loue well, being (as I haue said) a thing most impossible to constraine the <hi>Will.</hi> That is true, quoth the olde man, and I protest Sir, that I am wholly innocent of the imputation of Witchcraft: as for being a Baude, I could not denie it: but yet I neuer thought that I did ill therein; for all mine intention was that all the world should disport them, and liue together in concord and quietnesse without griefes or quarrels: but this my good desire auailed me but little to hinder my going there; from whence I haue no hope euer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, my yeares doe so burden me, and also the stone, which lets me not rest an instant. And saying this, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe to his lamentation as at the first, and <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke such compassion on him, as setting his hand into his bosome, he drew out a couple of shillings, and gaue it him as an almes.</p>
               <p>From him <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> past to another, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his fault; who answered with no lesse but with much more pleasantnesse then the former: I goe heere because I haue jested somewhat too much with two cousen Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of mine owne, and with two other sisters, which were none of mine: finally, I jested so much with them all, that thence resulted the increase of my kindred so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricately, as there is no Casuist that can well resolue it. All was proued by me, I wanted fauour, I had no money, and was in danger to lose my head: finally, I was condemned for sixe yeares to the Gallies. I consented, it is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my fault; I am young, and let my life but holde out a while longer, and all will goe well. And if you Sir
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:173111:112"/> Knight carry any thing to succour vs poore folke, God will reward you it in heauen, and we will haue care here on earth to desire God in our daily prayers for your life and health, that it be as long and as good as your good countenance deserues. He that said this, went in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of a student, and one of the guard tolde him that hee was a great talker, and a very good Latinist.</p>
               <p>After all these came a man of some thirty yeares olde, of very comely personage, saue onely that when he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he seemed to thrust the one eye into the other. Hee was differently tied from the rest; for he carried about his legge so long a chain, that it tired all the rest of his body: and he had besides two yron rings about his necke, the one of the chaine, and the other of that kinde which are called <hi>A keepe friend,</hi> or the foote of a friend. From whence descended two yrons vnto his middle, out of which did sticke two manacles, wherein his hands were lookt vp with a great hanging looke; so as he could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther set his hands to his mouth, nor bend down his head towards his hands. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demanded why he was so loaden with yron more then the rest? The guard an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, because he alonehad committed more faults then all together, and was a more desperate knaue, and that although they carried him tied in that sort, yet went they not sure of him, but feared hee would make an escape. What faults can he haue so grieuous, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> since he hath onely deserued to be sent to the Gallies? he goeth, replied the guard to them for tenne yeares, which is equiualent to a ciuill death: neuer striue to know more but that this man is the notorious <hi>Gines of Passamonte,</hi> who is otherwise called <hi>Ginesilio of Parapilla.</hi> Master Commissarie, quoth the slaue, hearing him say so, go faire and softly, and runne not thus dilating of names and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, I am called <hi>Gines</hi> and not <hi>Ginesilio,</hi> and <hi>Passamonte</hi> is my surname, and not <hi>Parapilla,</hi> as you say, and let euery one turne about him, and he shall not doe little. Speake
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:173111:113"/> with lesse swelling, quoth the Commissarie, Sir thiefe of more then the <note n="*" place="margin">Marke, <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine length ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in Spaine for swords, which if any transgresse he is punished, &amp; the sword forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </note> Marke. If you will not haue me to make you hold your peace, maugre your teeth. It seemes well (quoth the slaue) that a man is carried as pleaseth God; but one day some body shall know whether I be called <hi>Ginesilio</hi> of <hi>Parapilla.</hi> Why doe not they call thee so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sener, quoth the guard? They doe, said <hi>Gines,</hi> but I will make that they shall not call me so, or I will fleece them; there where I mutter vnder my teeth. Sir Knight if you haue any thing to bestow on vs, giue it vs now, and bee gone in the name of God; for you doe tire vs with your too curious search of knowing other mens liues: and if you would know mine, you shall vnderstand that I am <hi>Gines of Passamonte,</hi> whose life is written (shewing his hand) by these two fingers. Hee sayes true, quoth the Commissary, for he himselfe hath penned his owne histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie so well as there is nothing more to bee desired: and leaues the booke pawned in the prison for two hundred Rials: and likewise meane to redeeme it, quoth <hi>Gines,</hi> though it were in for as many duckets. Is it so good a worke said <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> It is so good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Gines,</hi> that it quite puttes downe <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes,</hi> and as many others as are written or shall write of that kinde: for that which I dare affirme to you is, that it treates of true accidents, and those so delightfull that no like inuention can be compared to them. And how is the booke intituled, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> it is called, said he, <hi>The life of Gines of Passamonte.</hi> And is it yet ended, said the Knight? How can it be finished, replied he, my life being not yet ended? since all that is written is from the hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Why then belike you were there once before (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?)</hi> to serue God and the King, I haue beene in there another time foure yeares, and I know already how the Bisket and Prouant agree with my stomacke (quoth <hi>Gines)</hi> nor doth it grieue mee
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:173111:113"/> very much to returne vnto them; for there I shall haue leisure to finish my booke, and I haue many things yet to say: and in the Gallies of Spaine, there is more resting time then is requisite for that businesse, although I shall not neede much time to penne what is yet vnwritten; for I can if neede were, say it all by roate. Thou seemest to be ingenuous, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> and vnfortunate withall, quoth <hi>Gines;</hi> for mishaps doe still persecute the best wits. They persecute knaues, quoth the Commissary. I haue already spoken to Mast. Commissary, quoth <hi>Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi> to go faire and softly; for the Lords did not giue you that rode, to the end you should abuse vs wretches that goe here, but rather to guide and carrie vs where his Maiesty hath commanded, if not by the life of, tis enough that perhaps one day may come to light, the spottes that were made in the Inne. And let all the world peace and liue well, and speake better, for this is now too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. The Commissary held vp his rodde to strike <note place="margin">Regedeo. p. 202</note>
                  <hi>Passamonte</hi> in answere of his threates, but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> put himselfe betweene them, and intreated him not to vse him hardly, seeing it was not much that one who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his handes so tyed, should haue his tongue somewhat free: and then turning himself towards the slaues he said:</p>
               <p>I haue gathered out of all that which you haue said, deere brethren, that although they punish you for your faults, yet that the paines you goe to suffer, doe not very well please you, and that you march towards them with a very ill will, and wholly constrayned, and that perhaps the little courage this fellow had on the racke, the want of money that the other had, the small fauour that a third enioyed; and finally the wrested sentence of the Iudge, and the not executing that iustice that was on your sides haue beene cause of your miserie. All which doth present it selfe to my memory in such sort, as it perswadeth, yea and forceth me to effect that for you for which heauen sent me into the world, and made me professe that order
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:173111:114"/> of Knighthood which I follow, &amp; that vow which I made therein to fauour and assist the needfull, and those that are oppressed by others more potent. But for as much as I know that it is one of the partes of prudence, not to doe that by foule means, which may be accomplished by faire; I will intreate those Gentlemen your guardians and Commissary, they will please to loose and let you depart peaceably; for there will not want others to serue the King in better occasions; for it seemes to me a rigorous maner of proceeding, to make slaues of them whom God and nature created free. How much more good Sirs of the guard (added <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> seeing these poore men haue neuer committed any offence against you; let them answere for their sinnes in the other world: there is a God in heauen, who is not negligent in punishing the euill, nor rewarding the good: and it is no wise decent, that honourable men should be the executioners of other men, seeing they cannot gaine or loose much thereby. I demaund this of you in this peaceable and quiet manner, to the end that if you accomplish my request I may haue occasion to yeeld you thankes; and if you will not doe it willingly, then shall this Launce and this Sword, guided by the inuincible valour of mine arme force you to it.</p>
               <p>This is a pleasant doting, answered the Commissary, and an excellent jest, wherewithall you haue finished your large reasoning. Would you haue vs leaue vnto you those the King forceth? as if we had authority to let them goe, or you to commaund vs to doe it. Go on your way in a good houre gentle Sir, and settle the Bason you beare on your head somwhat righter, and search not thus whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Catte hath three feete. Thou art a Catte, and a Rat, and a Knaue, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and so with word and deed at once, he assaulted him so suddenly, as without giuing him leisure to defend himselfe, he struck him down to the earth very sore wounded with a blow of his Lance, and as fortune would, this was he that had the fire-locke
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:173111:114"/> piece, the rest of the guard remained astonished at the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accident; but at last returning againe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the horsemen set hand to their swords, and the footmen to their dartes, and all of them set vpon <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who did expect them very quietly: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly he would haue beene in danger, if the slaues percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the occasion offered to be so fit to recouer libertie, had not procured it by breaking the chaine wherein they were linked. The hurliburly was such, as the guards now began to runne to hinder the slaues from vntying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, now to offend <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who assaulted them; so that they could doe nothing auaileable to keepe their prisoners. <hi>Sancho</hi> for his part holpe to lose <hi>Gines of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samonte,</hi> who was the first that leaped free into the fielde without clogge, and setting vpon the ouerthrown Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary, he disarmed him of his sword and piece, and now ayming at the one and then at the other with it, without discharging, made all the guards to abandon the fielde, as well for feare of <hi>Passamontes</hi> piece, as also to shunne the maruellous showre of stones that the slaues now deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, powred on them. <hi>Sancho</hi> grew maruellous sadde at this successe; for he suspected that those which fledde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, would goe and giue notice of the violence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Holy brotherhood:</hi> which would presently issue in troupes to search the delinquents: and said as much to his Lord, requesting him to depart presently from thence and imboske himselfe in the mountaine, which was very neere. All is well, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> I know now what is fit to be done, and so calling together al the slaues that were in a tumult, and had stript the Commissary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they came all about him to heare what he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to whom he said:</p>
               <p>It is the part of people well borne to gratifie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the benefits they receiue, ingratitude being one of the sinnes that most offendeth the highest. I say it Sirs to this end, because you haue by manifest triall seene,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:173111:115"/> that which you haue receiued at my hand, in reward whereof I desire, and it is my will that all of you loaden with that chain from which I euen now freed your necks, goe presently to the city of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and there present your selues before the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and recount vnto her that her Knight <hi>of the Ilfauoured face</hi> sends you there to remember his seruice to her: and relate vnto her at large the manner of your freedome, all you that haue had such noble fortune, and this being done you may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goe where you please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gines de Passamonte</hi> answered for all the rest, saying; that which you demand good Sir (our releaser) is most impossible to be performed, by reason that we cannot go altogether through these wayes, but alone and deuided, procuring each of vs to hide himselfe in the bowels of the earth, to the end we may not be found by the <hi>Holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,</hi> which will doubtlesly set out to search for vs: that therefore which you may and ought to doe in this exigent is, to change this seruice and homage of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> into a certaine number of <hi>Aue Maries</hi> and <hi>Creedes,</hi> which we will say for your intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is a thing that may be accomplished by night or by day, running or resting, in peace or in warre; but to thinke that wee will returne againe to take vp our chaines, or set our selues in the way of <hi>Toboso,</hi> is as hard as to make vs beleeue, that it is now night, it being yet scarce ten of the clocke in the morning, and to demaund such a thing of vs, is as likely as to seeke for Peares of the Elme tree. I sweare by such a one (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> throughly inraged) Sir sonne of a whoore, <hi>Don Ginefilio</hi> of <hi>Paropillio,</hi> or howsoeuer you are called, that thou shalt goe thy selfe alone with thy taile betweene thy legges, and beare all the chaine in thy necke. <hi>Passamonte</hi> who was by nature very cholericke, knowing assuredly that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was not very wise (seeing he had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such a desperate act, as to seeke to giue them liberty)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173111:115"/> seeing himselfe thus abused, winked on his companions, and going a little aside, they sent such a shower of stones on <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as he had no leasure to couer himselfe with his Buckler, and poore <hi>Rozinante</hi> made no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the spurre, then if his sides were made of Brasse. <hi>Sancho</hi> ranne behinde his Asse, and by his meanes shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred himselfe from the clowde and showre of stones, that rained vpon both. And <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could not couer himselfe so well, but that a number of stones strucke him in the body with so great force, as they ouerthrew him at last to the ground, and scarce was he fallen when the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent leapt vpon him and tooke the bason off his head, and gaue him three or foure blowes with it on the shoulders, and after strucke it so oft about the ground as hee almost broke it to peeces. They tooke from him likewise a cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>socke which he wore vpon his armour, and thought also to take away his stockings, but that they were hindred by his grieues. From <hi>Sancho</hi> they tooke away his Cassocke, and left him in his haire, and diuiding all the spoiles of the battaile among themselues, they departed, euery one by the way he pleased troubled with greater care how to escape from the <hi>Holy brotherhood</hi> which they feared, then to lade themselues with the yron chaine, and goe and present themselues before the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi> The Asse, and <hi>Rozinante, Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alone. The Asse stood pensatiue, with his head hanging downewards, shaking now and then his eares, thinking that the storme of stones was not yet past, but that they still buzzed by his head. <hi>Rozinante</hi> lay ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by his Master, who was likewise strucke downe by another blow of a stone; <hi>Sancho</hi> in feare of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the <hi>Holy brotherhood,</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to see himselfe so misused by those very same, to whom he had done so much good.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>On-Quixote</hi> seeeing himselfe in so ill plight, said to his Squire <hi>Sancho,</hi> I haue heard say oft-times, that to doe good to men vnthankfull, is to cast water into the Sea. If I had beleeued what thou saidst to me, I might well haue preuented all this griefe: but now that is past, patience, and be wiser an other time: you wil take warning as much by this, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> as I am a <hi>Turke.</hi> But since you say, that if you had beleeued me you had auoyded this griefe, beleeue mee now and you shall eschue a greater: for you must wit, that no Knighthood nor Chiualry is of any authority with the <hi>Holy brotherhood;</hi> for it cares not two farthings for all the Knights errant in the world, and know, that mee thinkes I heare their arrows buzze about mine eares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. <hi>Sancho</hi> thou art a naturall coward, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but because thou mayest not say that I am obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that I neuer follow thine aduice, I will take thy counsell this time, and conucy my selfe from that furie which now thou fearest so much: but it shal be on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that thou neuer tell aliue nor dying to any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creature, that I retired or withdrew my selfe out of this danger for feare, but onely to satisfie thy requests. For if thou sayest any other thing, thou shalt belie mee most falsly: and euen from this very time till that, and from thence vntil now I giue thee the lie herein, and I say thou liest, and shalt lie as oft-times as thou sayest or doest thinke the contrary: and doe not replie to me. For in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173111:116"/> onely thinking that I withdraw my selfe out of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, but principally this, which seemes to cary with it some shadow of feare, I am about to remaine and expect heere alone, not onely for the <hi>Holy brotherhood,</hi> which thou na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest and fearest, but also for the brethren of the <hi>Twelue Tribes,</hi> for the <hi>Seuen Macchabees,</hi> for <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux,</hi> and for all the other brothers and brotherhoods in the world. Sir, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> to retire is not to flie, nor to expect is wisedome, when the danger exceedeth all hope; and it is the part of a wiseman to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe safe to day for to morrow; and not to aduenture himselfe wholly in one day. And know, that although I be but a rude Clowne, yet doe I for all that vnderstand somewhat of that which men call good gouernement: and therfore do not repent your selfe for following mine aduice, but mount on <hi>Rozinante</hi> if you be able; if not, I wil helpe you, and come after me, for my mind giues me that we shall now haue more vse of legges then of hands.</p>

                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leaped on his horse without replying a word, and <hi>Sancho</hi> guiding him on his Asse they both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that part of <note n="*" place="margin">A great and large mountaine of Spain.</note>
                  <hi>Sierra Morena</hi> that was neare vnto them; <hi>Sancho</hi> had a secret designe to crosse ouer it all, and issue at <hi>Ʋiso</hi> or <hi>Amodouar</hi> of <hi>Campo,</hi> and in the meane time to hide themselues for some dayes among those craggie and intricate rockes, to the end they might not be found by the <hi>Holy brotherhood,</hi> if it did make after them. And he was the more encouraged to doe this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw their prouision which he carried on his Asse had escapt safely out of the skirmish of the Gally-slaues: a thing which he accounted to be a miracle, considering the diligence that the slaues had vsed to search and carrie away all things with them. They arriued that night in to the very midst &amp; bowels of the mountain, &amp; there <hi>Sancho</hi> thought it fittest to spend that night, yea and some other few dayes also, at least as long as their victuals indured, and with this resolution they tooke vp their lodging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173111:117"/> a number of Corke trees that grew betweene two Rockes. But fatall chaunce, which according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those that haue not the light of faith, guideth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth, and compoundeth all as it liketh, ordayned that that famous cousener and thiefe <hi>Gines de Passamonte,</hi> who was before deliuered out of chains by <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> force and folly, perswaded through feare he conceiued of the <hi>Holy brotherhood</hi> (whom hee had iust cause to feare) resolued to hide himselfe likewise in that mountaine, and his fortune and feares ledde him iust to the place where it had first addrest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and his Squire, iust at such time as he might perceiue them, and they both at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant fallen asleepe. And as euill-men are euermore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, and that necessity forceth a man to attempt that which it vrgeth, and likewise that the present redresse preuents the expectation of a future, <hi>Gines</hi> who was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gratefull nor gratious, resolued to steale away <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> his Asse, making no account of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> as a thing neyther saleable nor pawnable. <hi>Sancho</hi> slept soundly, and so he stole his beast, and was before morning so farre off from thence, as he feared not to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurora</hi> sallied forth at last to refresh the earth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright <hi>Sancho</hi> with a most sorrowfull accident, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently missed his Asse, and so seeing himselfe depriued of him, he began the most sadde and dolefull lamentation of the world: in such sort as he awaked <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with his out-cries, who heard that hee said thus. O childe of my bowels, borne in mine owne house, the sport of my children, the comfort of my wife, and the enuie of my neighbours; the ease of my burdens, and finally the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stainer of halfe of my person; for with sixe and twentie <hi>Maruedijs</hi> that I gained daily by thee, I did defray halfe of mine expences. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> who heard the plaint, and knew also the cause did comfort <hi>Sancho</hi> with the best words he could deuise, and desired him to haue patience, promising to giue a letter of exchange, to the end that

                  </gap> promise, and dried vp his teares, moderated his sighes, and gaue his Lord thankes for so great a fauour. And as they entred in farther among those mountains we cannot recount the ioy of our Knight, to whom those places seemed most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to atchieue the aduentures he searched for. They reduced to his memory the maruellous accidents that had befalne Knights errant in like solitudes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts: and hee rode so ourwhelmed and transported by these thoughts, as he remembred nothing else. Nor <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> had any other care (after he was out of feare to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) but how to fill his belly with some of these relikes which yet remained of the Clericall spoyles; and so hee followed his Lord taking now and then out of a basket, (which <hi>Rozinante</hi> caried for want of the Asse) some meat and lining there with all his paunch; and whilst he went thus imployed, hee would not haue giuen a mite to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter any other aduenture how honourable soeuer.</p>
               <p>But whilst he was thus busied, he espyed his Master la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to take vp with the point of his Iaueline, some bulke or other that lay on the ground, and went towards him to see whether he needed his helpe iust at the season that he lifted vp a saddle cushion and a Portmantew fast to it, which were halfe rotten, or rather wholly rotted by the weather; yet they weighed so much that <hi>Sanchoes</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance was requisite to take them vp: and straight his Lord commaunded him to see what was in the Wallet. <hi>Sancho</hi> obeyed with expedition. And although it was shut with a chaine and hanging locke, yet by the parts which were torne he saw what was within, to wit foure fine holland shirts, and other linnens both curious and cleane: and moreouer a handkercher, wherein was a good quantity of gold: which he perceiuing said, Blessed be heauen which hath once presented to vs a beneficiall
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173111:118"/> aduenture: and searching for more, he found a Tablet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry costly bound. This <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke of him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding him to keepe the golde with himselfe; for which rich fauour <hi>Sancho</hi> did presently kisse his handes: and after taking all the linnen, he clapt it vp in the bagge of their victuals. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hauing noted all these things, said, Me thinkes <hi>Sancho</hi> (and it cannot be possible any other) that some traueller hauing left his way, past through this mountaine, &amp; being encountred by thieues, they slew him, and buried him in this secret place? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> for if they were theeues they would not haue left this money behinde them. Thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture what it might be: but stay a while, we will see whether there be any thing written in these Tablets, by which wee may vent and finde out that which I desire. Then he opened it, and the first thing that he found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it, as it were a first draught, but done with a very faire Character, was a Sonnet which he read aloude, that <hi>Sancho</hi> might also heare it, and was this which ensues.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>OR loue of vnderstanding quite is voyde:</l>
                  <l>Or he abounds in cruelty, or my paine</l>

                  <l>The torments dyre, he maketh me sustaine.</l>
                  <l>But if loue be a God, I dare maintaine</l>
                  <l>He nought ignores: and reason aye decides</l>
                  <l>Gods should not cruell be: then who ordaines</l>
                  <l>This paine I worship, which my heart diuides?</l>
                  <l>Filis! I erre, if thou I say it is:</l>
                  <l>For so great ill and good cannot consist.</l>
                  <l>Nor doth this wracke from heau'n befall but yet.</l>
                  <l>That shortly I must die, can no way misse:</l>
                  <l>For th'euill whose cause is hardly well exprest</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Nothing can be learned by that verse, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:173111:118"/> if by that <note n="*" place="margin">An allusion to the Spanish word <hi>Hilo,</hi> signifying a threed.</note>
                  <hi>Hilo</hi> or threed which is said there, you gather not where lies the rest of the clue, what <hi>Hilo</hi> is heere, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Me thought, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you read <hi>Hilo</hi> there. I did not but <hi>Fili,</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> which is without doubt the name of the Lady, on whom the Authour of this Sonnet complaines, who in good truth seemes to be a reasonable good Poet, or els I know but little of that arte. Why then, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> belike you doe also vnderstand <hi>Poetry?</hi> That I doe, and more then thou thinkest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> as thou shalt see when thou shalt carry a letter from me to my Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea del Toboso,</hi> written in verse from the one end to the other: For I would thou shouldest know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that all or the greater number of Knights errant in times past were great Versifiers and Musitians, for these two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or graces as I may better terme them, are annext to amourous Knights aduentures. True it is that the verses of the auncient Knights are not so adorned with words, as they are rich in conceits. I pray you reade more, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for perhaps you may finde somewhat that may satisfie. Then <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned the leafe, and said, This is prose, and it seemes to be a letter. What Sir, a missiue letter, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> No but rather of loue, according to the beginning, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> reade it loude enough, for I take great delight in these things of loue. I am content, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and reading it loudly as <hi>Sancho</hi> had reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, it said as ensueth.</p>
               <p>Thy false promise and my certaine misfortune, do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me to such a place, as from thence thou shalt sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue newes of my death, then reasons of my iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Thou hast disdained me <hi>(O ingrate)</hi> for one that hath more, but not for one that is worth more then I am: but if vertue were a treasure of estimation, I would not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate other mens fortunes, nor weep thus for mine own misfortunes. That which thy beauty erected, thy works
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:173111:119"/> haue ouerthrowne: by it I deemed thee to be an Angell, and by these I certainely know thee to be but a woman. Rest in peace <hi>(O causer of my warre)</hi> and let heauen worke so that thy spouses deceipts remaine still concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to the end thou maist not repent what thou didst, and I bee constrained to take reuenge of that I desire not.</p>
               <p>Hauing read the letter, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said, we can col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect lesse by this then by the letter. What the Authour is, other then that he is some disdayned louer, and so passing ouer all the booke, he found other Verses and Letters, of which hee could read some, others not at all. But the summe of them all were, accusations, plaints, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts, pleasures, griefes, fauours, and disdaines, some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, others deplored. And whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> past ouer the booke, <hi>Sancho</hi> past ouer the mallet, without leauing a corner of it, or the cushion vnsearched, or a seame vnript, nor a locke of wooll vncarded, to the end nothing might remaine behinde for want of diligence, or carelessenesse, they found gold which past a hundred crowns, had stird in him such a greedinesse to haue more. And though he got no more then that which he found at the first, yet did he account his flights in the couerlet, his vomiting of the drench, the benedictions of the packe slaues, the blowes of the Carrier, the losse of his wallet, the robbing of his Cassocke, and all the hunger, thirst, and wearnesse that he had past in the seruice of his good Lord and Master, for well imployed; accounting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be more then well paied, by the gifts receiued of the money they found. The Knight of the <hi>Il fauoured face</hi> was the while possessed with a maruailous desire to know who was the owner of the mallet, coniecturing by the Sonnet, and letter, the gold, and linuen, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured was some man of worth, whom the disdaine and rigour of his Lady had conducted to some desperate termes. But by reason that no body appeared, through
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:173111:119"/> that inhabitable and desart place, by whom he might be informed; he thought on it no more, but only roadē on, without choosing any other way, then that which pleased <hi>Rozinante</hi> to trauaile, who tooke the plainest and easiest to passe through: hauing still an imagination that there could not want some strange aduenture, amidst that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
               <p>And as he roade on, with this conceipt he saw a man on the toppe of a little mountaine that stood iust before his face, leape from rocke to rocke, and tuffe to tuffe with wonderfull dexterity. And as he thought he was naked, had a blacke and thicke beard, the haires many and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly mingled, his feete and legges bare, his thighes were couered with a paire of hose, which seemed to bee of Murry veluet, but were so torne that they discouered his flesh in many places: his head was likewise bare, and although he past by with the hast we haue recounted, yet did <hi>the Knight of the Il fauoured face,</hi> note all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, and although he indeuoured, yet could not hee follow him, for it was not in <hi>Rozinantes</hi> power, in that weake state wherein he was to trauaile so swiftly among those rocks, chiefly being naturally very flow and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> after espying him did instantly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine him to be owner of the cushion and mallet; and therefore resolued to goe on in his search, although hee should spend a whole yeare therein among those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: and commanded <hi>Sancho</hi> to goe about the one side of the mountaine, and he would goe the other, and quoth hee, it may befall that by vsing this diligence wee may incounter with that man, which vanished so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely out of our sight. I cannot doe so, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> for that in parting one step from you, feare present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so assaults mee with a thousand visions and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And let this serue you hereafter for a warning, to the end you may not from henceforth part me the blacke of a naile from your presence. It shall bee so, answereth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:173111:120"/>
                  <hi>the Knight of the ill-fauoured face.</hi> And I am very glad that thou dost thus build vpon my valour, the which shall neuer faile thee, although thou didst want thy very soule: and therefore follow me by little and little, or as thou maist, and make of thine eyes two Lant-hornes, for wee giue a turne to this little rocke, and perhaps wee may meete with this man whom we saw euen now, who doubtlesly can be none other then the owner of our boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. To which <hi>Sancho</hi> replyed, it were much better not to finde him: for if we should meet him, and were by chance the owner of this money, it is most euident that I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it to him, and therefore it is better without vsing this vnprofitable diligence to let me possesse it <hi>bona fide,</hi> vntill the true Lord shall appeare by some way lesse cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and diligent: which perhaps may fall at such a time as it shall be all spent; and in that case I am freed from all processes by priuiledge of the King. Thou deceiuest thy selfe <hi>Sancho</hi> therein, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for seeing wee are falne already into suspition of the owner, wee are bound to search and restore it to him: and when wee would not seeke him out, yet the vehement presumption that we haue of it hath made vs possessors <hi>mala fide,</hi> and renders vs as culpable, as if he whom we surmise, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the true Lord. So that friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> be not grieued to seeke him, in respect of the griefe whereof thou shalt free me if he be found. And saying so, spurd <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> followed after a foote, animated by the hope of the young Asses his Master had promised vnto him: &amp; hauing compassed a part of the mountain, they found a little stream, wherin lay dead, and halfe deuoured by dogs and crows, a Mule sadled and bridled, al which confirmed more in them the suspition that hee which fledde away was owner of the Mule and cushion. And as they looked on it, they heard a whistle, much like vnto that which Sheepheards vse, as they keepe their flockes, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared at their left hand a great number of Goates,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173111:120"/> after whom the Goatheard that kept them, who was an aged man, followed on the toppe of the mountaine; and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> cried to him, requesting him to come down to them, who answered them againe as loudly, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them who had brought them to those desarts, rarely troden by any other then Goats, Wolues, or other sauage beastes which frequented those mountaines? <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cho</hi> answered him; that if hee would descend where they were, they would giue him account thereof. With that the Sheepheard came downe, and arriuing to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, he said, I dare wager that you looke on the hyred Mule which lies dead there in that bottom; well, in good faith he lies in that very place these sixe moneths. Say, I pray you, haue not you met in the way with the master thereof? We haue encountred no body but a cushion and a little Mallet which wee found not very farre off from hence. I did likewise finde the same, replyed the Goatheard, but I would neuer take it vp nor approach to it, fearefull of some misdemeanor, or that I should be hereafter demaunded for it as for a stealth. For the Diuell is crafty, and now and then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing riseth, euen from vnder a mans feete, whereat hee stumbles and falles, without knowing how, or how not. That is the very same I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I likewise found it, but would not approach it the cast of a stone. There I haue left it, and there it remaines as it was; for I <hi>would not haue a dogge with a bell.</hi> Tell me good fellow, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> dost thou know who is the owner of all these things?</p>
               <p>That which I can say, answered the Goatheard, is that about some sixe moneths past, little more or lesse; there arriued at a certaine sheepe-fold some three leagues off, a young Gentleman of comely personage, and presence, mounted on that very <hi>Mule</hi> which lies dead there, and with the same Cushion and Mallet which you say you met, but touched not. He demaunded of vs which was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173111:121"/> the most hidden and inaccessable part of the mountaine, and we told him that this wherein we are now: and it is true; for if you did enter but halfe a league farther, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would not finde the way out againe so readily: and I doe greatly maruell how you could finde the way hither it selfe; for there is neyther high way nor path that may addresse any to this place. I say then, that the young man as soone as he heard our answere, hee turned the bridle, and trauelled towards the place wee shewed to him, leauing vs all with very great liking of his comelines and maruell, at his demaund and speed wherewith he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and made towards the mountaine: and after that time we did not see him a good many of daies, vntill by chance one of our sheepheards came by with our proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of victuals, to whom he drew neere, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, and spurned and beate him welfauourdly, and after went to the Asse which carried our victuals, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all the bread and cheese that was there, hee sled into the mountaine with wonderfull speede. When we heard of this, some of vs Goatheards, wee went to search for him, and spent therein almost two dayes in the most solitary places of this mountaine, and in the end found him lurking in the hollow part of a very tall and great Corke tree; who as soone as he perceiued vs, came forth to meete vs, with great stayednes: his apparrell was all torne, his visage disfigured, and tosted with the Sunne in such manner, as we could scarce know him, if it were not that his attire, although rent, by the notice we had of it did giue vs to vnderstand, that hee was the man for whom we sought. He saluted vs courteously, and in briefe and very good reasons he said, that we ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, seeing him goe in that manner: for that it behoued to doe so, that hee might accomplish a certaine penance inioyned to him, for the many sinnes he had committed. We prayed him to tell vs what he was, but we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perswade him to it. We requested him likewise that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173111:121"/> whensoeuer he had any neede of meat (without which he could not liue) he should tell vs where wee might finde him and we would bring it to him with great loue and diligence; and that if he also did not like of this motion, that he would at leastwise come and aske it, &amp; not take it violently as he had done before from our Sheepheards. He thanked vs very much for our offer, and intreated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the assaults passed, and promised to aske it from thence forward for Gods sake, without giuing annoyance to any one. And touching his dwelling or place of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, he said that he had none other then that where the night ouertooke him, and ended his discourse with so feeling laments, that we might well be accounted stones which heard him, if therein we had not kept him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, considering the state wherein we had seene him first; and that wherein now he was. For as I said he was a very comely and gracious young man, and shewed by his courteous and orderly speech, that he was well borne, and a courtlike person. For though wee were all Clownes, such as did heare him, his Gentility was such, as could make it selfe knowne, euen to rudenesse it selfe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the best of his Discourse, he stopt and grew silent, fixing his eyes on the ground a good while, wherein wee likewise stood still suspended, expecting in what that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction would end, with no little compassion to behold it; for we easily perceiued that some accident of madnes had surprised him, by his staring and beholding the earth so fixedly, without once mouing the eye-lidde, and other times by the shutting of them, the biting of his lips, and bending of his browes. But very speedily after he made vs certaine thereof himselfe: for rising from the ground (whereon he had throwne himselfe a little before) with great furie, he set vpon him that sate next vnto him, with such courage and rage, that if wee had not taken him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he would haue slaine him with blows and bites, and he did all this, saying, O treacherous <hi>Fernando</hi> here, heere
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:173111:122"/> thou shalt pay me the iniurie that thou didst me: these handes shall rent out the heart, in which do harbour and are heaped all euils together, but principally fraude and deceit: and to these he added other wordes, all address to the dispraise of that <hi>Fernando,</hi> and to attach him of treason and vntruth. Wee tooke from him at last, not without difficulty our fellow, and hee without saying a word departed from vs, embushing himselfe presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bushes &amp; brambles, leauing vs wholly disabled to follow him in those rough and vnhaunted places. By this we gathered that his madnes comes to him at times, and that some one called <hi>Fernando,</hi> some ill worke of such waight, as the terms shew, to which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hath brought him. All which hath after beene yet confirmed as often, (which were many times) as he came out to the fieldes, sometimes to demaund meat of the Sheepheards, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times to take it of them perforce: for when hee is taken with this fit of madnesse, although the Sheepheards doe offer him meat willingly, yet will not he receiue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he take it with buffets: and when hee is in his right sense he askes it for Gods sake, with courtesie and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and renders many thankes, and that not without teares. And in very truth Sirs, I say vnto you, quoth the Goatheard, that I and foure others, whereof two are my men, other two my friends, resolued Yesterday to search vntill we found him; and being found, eyther by force or faire meanes, we will carry him to the towne of <hi>Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauar,</hi> which is but eight leagues from hence; and there will we haue him cured, if his disease may be holpen, or at least we shall learne what he is, when he turnes to his wits, and whether he hath any friends to whom notice of his misfortune may be giuen. This is Sirs, all that I can say concerning that which you demaunded of me; and you shall vnderstand that the owner of those things which you saw in the way is the very same, whome you saw passe by you so naked &amp; nimble. For <hi>Don-Quixote</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:173111:122"/> had told him by this, that hee had seene that man goe by leaping among the Rockes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested maruellously admired at the Goatheards tale, &amp; with greater desire to know who that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate mad-man was, purposed with himselfe, as hee had already resolued to search him throughout the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, without leauing a corner or Caue of it vnsought, vntill he had gotten him. But fortune disposed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter better then he expected, for he appeared in that very instant in a clift of a Rocke, that answered to the place where they stood speaking, who came towards them murmuring somewhat to himselfe which they could not bee vnderstood neere at hand, and much lesse a farre off His apparell was such as we haue deliuered, onely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiued when he drew nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that he wore on him, although torne, a leather Ierkin of <hi>Ambar.</hi> By which he throughly collected, that the person which wore such attire, was not of the least quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. When the young man came to the place where they discoursed, he saluted them with a hoarse voyce, but with great courtesie: and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> returned him his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with no lesse complement; and allighting from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> he aduanced to embrace him with very good carriage and countenance, and held him a good while straightly betweene his armes, as if he had knowne him of long time; the other whom we may call the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Knight of the Rocke, as well as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> the Knight of the ill fauoured face, after hee had permitted himselfe to be embraced a while, did stop a little off from our Knight; and laying his hand on his shoulders, began to behold him earnestly, as one desirous to call to minde whether he had euer seene him before: being perhaps no lesse admired to see <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> figure, proportion and armes, then <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> was to view him. In resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first that spoke after the embracing was the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Knight, and said what we will presently recount.</p>

So great is mine affection, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to serue you, as I was fully resolued neuer to depart out of these mountaines vntill I had found you, and known of your selfe whether there might be any kind of remedie found for the griefe, that this your so vnusuall a kinde of life argues, doth possesse your soule. And if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to search it out with all possible diligence: and when your disaster were known of those which clap their doors in the face of comfort, I intended in that case to beare a part in your lamentations, &amp; plaine it with the dolefullest note; for it is a consolation in afflictions to haue one that condoles in them. And if this my good intention may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite any acceptance, or be gratified by any courtesie, let me intreat you Sir by the excesse therof, which I see accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in your bosom, &amp; iointly I coniure you by that thing which you haue, or do presently most affect that you will please to disclose vnto me who you are, &amp; what the cause hath bin that perswaded you to come, to liue and die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these desarts, like a bruit beast, seeing you liue among such, so alienated from your selfe, as both your attire and

               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Rocke,</hi> who heard him of <hi>the ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red face</hi> speake in that maner, did nothing else for a great while, but behold him again &amp; again, and rebehold him from top to toe. And after viewing him wel he said, if you haue any thing to eate, I pray you giue it me for Gods sake, &amp; after I haue eaten I will satisfie your demand tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, to gratifie the many courtesies &amp; vndeserued pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you haue made vnto me. <hi>Sancho</hi> and the Goatheard presents the one out of his Wallet, the other out of his Scrip, tooke some meat and gaue it to the Knight of the Rocke to allay his hunger, and he did eate so fast, like a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted man, as he left no intermission between bit &amp; bit, but clapt them vp so swiftly, as he rather seemed to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low then to chew them, &amp; whilst he did eate, neither he or any of the rest spoke a word: &amp; hauing ended his dinner, he made them signes to follow him, as at last they did, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little meadow seated hard by that place, at the folde of a mountain; where being arriued, he stretched himselfe on the grasse, which the rest did likewise in his imitation, without speaking a word, vntill that he after setling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his place, began in this manner: if Sirs, you please to heare the immanity of my disasters briefly rehearsed, you must promise me, that you will not interrupt the file of my dolefull narration, with either demaund or other thing; for in the very instant that you shall do it, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must remain that which I say depending. These words of our ragged Knights, called to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the tale which his Squire had told vnto him when he erred in the account of his Goats, which had passed the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:173111:124"/> riuer, for which that History remained suspended. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to our ragged man; hee said, this preuention which now I giue, is to the end that I may compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously passe ouer the discourse of my mishaps, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking of them to remembrance only, serues me to none other steed, then to increase the olde by adding of new misfortunes; and by how much the fewer your questions are, by so much the more speedily shal I haue finished my pittifull Discourse; and yet I meane not to omit my es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential point of my woes vntoucht, that your desires may be herein sufficiently satisfied. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his own, and his other companions name, promised to performe his request; whereupon hee began his relation in this manner:</p>
               <p>My name is <hi>Cardenic,</hi> the place of my birth, one of the best Cities in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> my linage noble, my parents rich, and my misfortunes so great, as I thinke my parents haue e're this deplored, &amp; my kinsfolke condoled them; being very little able with their wealth to redresse them; for the goods of fortune are but of smal vertue to remedy the disasters of heauen. There dwelt in the same Citie a heauen, wherin loue had placed all the glory that I could desire; so great as the beauty of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> a damzell as noble and rich as I: but more fortunate and lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant then my honourable desires expected. I loued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and adored this <hi>Luscinda,</hi> almost from my very infancy; and she affected me likewise, with all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and good will, which with her so young yeares did accord. Our parents knew our mutuall amity; for which they were nothing aggrieued, perceiuing very well, that although we continued it, yet could it haue none other end but that of Matrimony; a thing which the equality of our blood and substance did of it selfe almost inuite vs to. Our age and affection increased in such sort, as it seemed fit to <hi>Luscindas</hi> father, for certaine good respects to denie me the entrance of his house any longer; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:173111:124"/> in a manner therein <hi>Tisbi,</hi> so much solemnized by the Poets, her parents; which hinderance serued onely to adde flame to flame, and desire to desire: for although it set silence to our tongues, yet could they not impose it to our pens, which are wont to expresse to whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the most hidden secrecies of our soules with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then the tong; for the presence of the beloued doth often distract, trouble, &amp; strike dumbe the boldest tongue and firmest resolution. O heauens, how many letters haue I written vnto her? What cheerefull and honest answers haue I receiued? How many ditties and amorous verses haue I composed, wherein my foule declared and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed her passions, declined her enflamed desires, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her remembrance, and recreated her will? In effect perceiuing my selfe to be forced, and that my soule consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a perpetuall desire to behold her, I resolued to put my desires in execution, and finish in an instant that which I deemed most expedient for the better atchieuing of my desired and deserued reward; which was (as I did indeede) to demaund her of her father for my lawfull Spouse. To which he made answere, that he did gratifie the good will which I shewed by honouring him, and desire to honour my selfe with pawnes that were his: but yet seeing my father yet liued, the motion of that matter properly most concerned him. For if it were not done with his good liking and pleasure, <hi>Luscinda</hi> was not a woman to be taken or giuen by stealth. I rendred him thankes for his good will, his wordes seeming vnto mee very reasonable, at that my father would agree vnto them, as soone as I should explane the matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed presently to acquaint him with my desires; who at the time which I entred into a chamber, wherein he was, stood with a letter open in his hand; and espying me, e're I could breake my minde vnto him, gaue it me, saying: by that letter <hi>Cardenio,</hi> you may gather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> beares, to doe you any pleasure or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:173111:125"/> fauour. This Duke <hi>Ricardo,</hi> as I thinke you know <hi>Sirs</hi> already, is a <hi>Grande</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whose Dukedome is seated in the best part of all <hi>Andalnzia.</hi> I tooke the letter and read it; which appeared so vrgent; as I my selfe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it would be ill done, if my father did not accomplish the contents thereof, which were indeed, that he should presently addresse me to his Court, to the end I might be companion (and not seruant) to his eldest sonne; and that he would incharge himselfe with the aduancing of me to such preferments as might be answerable vnto the value and estimation he made of my person. I past ouer the whole letter, &amp; was strucken dumbe at the reading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but chiefly hearing my father to say <hi>Cardenio,</hi> thou must depart within two dayes, to accomplish the Dukes desire; and omit not to render Almighty God thankes, which doth thus open the way, by which thou mayest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in fine to that which I know thou doest merite; and to these words added certaine others of fatherly counsaile and direction. The terme of my departure arriued, and I spoke to my <hi>Luscinda</hi> on a certaine night, and recounted vnto her all that passed, and likewise to her father, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to ouerslip a few daies, &amp; deferre the bestowing of his daughter else-where, vntill I went to vnderstand Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> his will: which he promised me, and shee confirmed it with a thousand oathes and promises. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I came to Duke <hi>Ricardoes</hi> Court, as was so friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and entertained by him, as euen very then enuie began to exercise her accustomed function, being forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with emulated by the auncient Seruiters; perswading themselues, that the tokens the Duke shewed to doe me fauours, could not but turne to their preiudice. But hee that reioyced most at mine arriuall, was a second sonne of the Dukes called <hi>Fernando,</hi> who was young, gallant, very comely, liberall, and amorous; who within a while after my comming held me so deerely, as euery one wondred thereat: and though the elder loued me well, and did me
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:173111:125"/> fauour, yet was it in no respect comparable to that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall <hi>Don Fernando</hi> loued and treated me. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore befell, that as there is no secresie amongst friends so great, but they will communicate it the one to the other and the familiarity which I had with <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> was now past the limits of fauour, and turned into deerest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, he reuealed vnto me all his thoughts, but chiefly one of his loue, which did not a little molest him. For he was enamoured on a Farmers daughter that was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vassall, whose parents were maruellous rich, and she her selfe so beautifull, wary, discreete, and honest, as neuer a one that knew her could absolutely determine wherein in which of all her perfections she did most excell or was most accomplished. And those good parts of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull countrey-maide reduced <hi>Don Fernando</hi> his desires to such an exigent, as he resolued that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaine her good will, and conquere her integrity, to passe her a promise of marriage, for otherwise he should labour to effect that which was impossible, and but striue against the streame. I, as one bound thereunto by our friendship, did thwart and dislwade him from his purpose with the best reasons, &amp; most efficacious words I might: and seeing all could not preuaile, I determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> his father therewithall. But <hi>Don Fernando</hi> being very crafty and discreete, suspected and feared as much, because he considered that in the law of a faithfull seruant, I was bound not to conceale a thing that would turne so much to the preiudice of the Duke my Lord: and therefore both to diuert and deceiue me at once, that he could finde no meanes so good, to deface the remembrance of that beauty out of his minde, which held his hart in such subiection, then to absent himself for certaine moneths: and he would likewise haue that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be this, that both of vs should depart together, and come to my fathers house, vnder pretence (as hee would informe the Duke) that he went to see and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:173111:126"/> certaine great horses that were in the Citie wherein I was borne; a place of breeding the best horses in the world. Scarce had I heard him say this (when borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the naturall propension each one hath to his countrey, and my loue ioynde) although his designment had not beene so good, yet would I haue ratified it, as one of the most expedient that could be imagined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I saw occasion and oportunity so fairely offred, to returne and see againe my <hi>Luscinda.</hi> And thereof set on by this thought and desire, I approued his opinion, and did quicken his purpose, perswading him to prosecute it with all possible speede, for absence would in the end work her effect in despite of the most forcible and vrgent thoughts; and when he said this to me, hee had already vnder the title of a husband (as it was afterward knowne) reaped the fruits of his longing desires, from his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countrey maide, and did onely await an oportunity to reueale it without his owne detriment; fearefull of the Duke his fathers indignation, when he should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his errour.</p>
               <p>It afterward hapned that as loue in young men is not for the most part loue but lust, the which (as it euer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to it selfe as his last end and period is delight) so as soone as it obtaineth the same, it likewise decaieth and maketh forcibly to retire that which was termed loue; for it cannot transgresse the limits which Nature hath assigned it, which boundings or meares nature hath in no wise allotted to true and sincere affection. I would say that as soone as <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> had inioyed his Country lasse, his desires weakned, and his importunities waxed colde; and if at the first he fained an excuse to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe, that he might with more facility compasse them, he did now in very good earnest procure to depart to the end he might not put them in execution. The Duke gaue him license to depart, and commaunded me to accompany him. We came to my Citie, where my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173111:126"/> entertayned him according to his calling. I saw <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda,</hi> and then againe were reuiu'd (although indeede they were neither dead nor mortified) my desires, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Don Fernando</hi> (alas to my totall ruine) with them, because I thought it was not lawfull by the law of amity to keepe any thing concealed from him. There I dilated to him, on the beauty, wit, and discretion of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda</hi> in so ample manner, as my prayses stirred in him a desire to view a damzell so greatly adorned, and inriched with so rare endowments: and this his desire I through my misfortune satisfied, shewing her vnto him by the light of a candle, at a window where we two were wont to parle together; where he beheld her to be such, as was sufficient to blot out of his memory al the beauties which euer he had viewed before. He stood mute, beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and rauished: and moreouer rested so greatly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, as you may perceiue in the Discourse of this my dolefull narration. And to inflame his desires the more, (a thing which I fearefully auoyded, and onely discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to heauen) fortune so disposed that he found after me one of her letters, wherein she requested that I would demand her of her father for wife; which was so discreet, honest and amorously penned, as he said after reading it, that in <hi>Luscinda</hi> alone were included all the graces of beauty and vnderstanding ioyntly, which were diuided and separate in all the other women of the world. Yet in good sooth I wil here confesse the truth, that although I saw cleerely how deseruedly <hi>Luscinda</hi> was thus extolde by <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> yet did not her praises please me so much pronounced by him; and therefore began to feare and suspect him, because he let no moment ouerslip vs without making some mention of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d still himselfe begin the discourse, were the occasion euer so far-fetched: a thing which rowsed in me I cannot tell what iealousie; nor that I did feare any trauerse in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scindas</hi> loyalty, but yet for all my fates made me the very
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:173111:127"/> thing which they most assured me: and <hi>Don Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> procured to read all the papers I sent to <hi>Luscinda,</hi> or she to me, vnder pretext that he tooke extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to note the witty conceits of vs both. It therefore fell out, that <hi>Luscinda</hi> hauing demaunded of me a booke of Chiualry to reade, wherein she tooke maruellous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and was that of <hi>Amadis du Gaule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce had <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> well heard him make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bookes of Knighthood, when he replied to him; if you had good Sir but once tolde me at the beginning of your Historicall narration, that your Lady <hi>Luscinda</hi> was affected to the reading of Knightly aduentures, you nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to haue vsed any amplification to indeere or make plaine vnto me the eminencie of her wit; which certainly could not in any wise be so excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous as you haue figured it, if she wanted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension and feeling you haue rehearsed, to the perusing of so pleasing discourses: so that henceforth with me, you need not spend any more words to explane and manifest the height of her beauty, worthes and vnderstanding; for by this onely notice I haue receiued of her deuotion two books of Knighthood, I do confirm her for the most faire and accomplished woman for all perfections in the world: and I would to God good Sir, that you had also sent her together with <hi>Amadis</hi> the Histories of the good <hi>Don Rugel of Grecia;</hi> for I am certaine the Lady <hi>Luscin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> would haue taken great delight in <hi>Darayda</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raya,</hi> and in the wittie conceits of the Sheepheard <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> and in these admirable verses of his Bucolickes, sung and rehearsed by him with such grace, discretion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But a time may come, wherein this fault may be recompenced, if it shall please you to come with me to my village; for there I may giue you three hundred bookes, which are my soules greatest contentment, and the intertainment of my life; although I doe now verily beleeue that none of them are left, thankes be to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:173111:127"/> of euill and enuious inchanters. And I beseech you to pardon me this transgression of our agreement at the first, promised not to interrupt your Discourses: for when I heare any motion made of Chiualry or Knights errant, it is no more in my power to omit to speake of them, then in the Sunne-beames to leaue off warming, or in the Moones to render things humid. And therefore I intreat pardon, and that you will prosecute your History, which is that which most imports vs.</p>
               <p>Whilest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> spoke those wordes <hi>Cardenio</hi> hanged his head on his brest, giuing manifest tokens that he was exceeding sad. And although <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him twice to follow on with his Discourse, yet neither did he lift vp his head, or answer a word, till at last after he had stood a good while musing, hee held vp his head and said; it cannot be taken out of my minde, nor is there any one in the world can depriue me of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or make me beleeue the contrary: and hee were a bottle-head that would thinke or beleeue otherwise then that the great villaine, Master <hi>Elisabat</hi> the Barber kept Queene <hi>Madasima</hi> as his Lemman. That is not so I vow by such and such, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in great cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler (and as he was wont, rapt out three or foure round oathes) and it is great malice, or rather villany to say such a thing. For Queene <hi>Madasima</hi> was a very noble Lady, and it ought not to be presumed that so high a Princesse would fall in loue with a Quack-saluer: and whosoeuer thinkes the contrary, lies like an arrant villaine; as I will make him vnderstand a horsebacke or a foote, armed or disarmed, by night or by day, or as he best liketh. <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> stood beholding him very earnestly as he spoke these wordes, whom the accident of his madnesse had by this possessed, and was not in plight to prosecute his History: nor would <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> giue eare to it, he was so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily disgusted to heare Queene <hi>Madasima</hi> detracted. A maruellous accident, for he tooke her defence as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:173111:128"/> as if she were verily his true and naturall Princesse; his wicked bookes had so much distracted him. And <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> being by this furiously madde, hearing himselfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with the lie, and the denomination of a villaine, with other the like outrages, he tooke the rest in ill part, and lifting vp a stone that was neere vnto him, gaue <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> such a blow therewithall, as he ouerthrew him to the ground on his backe. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> seeing his Master so roughly handled, set vpon the foole with his fist shut; and the ragged man receiued his assault in such manner, as he likewise ouerthrew him to his feete with one fist, and mounting afterward vpon him, did worke him with his feete like a piece of dough: and the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard who thought to succour him, was like to incurre the same danger. And after hee had ouerthrowne and beaten them all very well, he departed from them and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the wood very quietly. <hi>Sancho</hi> arose, and with rage to see himselfe so belaboured without desert, he ran vpon the Goatheard to be reuenged on him, saying that he was in the fault, who had not premonished them, how that mans rauing fits, did take him so at times; for had they beene aduertised thereof, they might haue stood all the while on their guard. The Goatheard answered, that he had already aduised them thereof; and if hee had not beene attentiue thereunto, yet he was therefore nothing the more culpable. <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> replied, and the Goatheard made a reioyndrie thereunto, but their dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ended at last, in the catching hold of one anothers beards, and befisting themselues so vncompassionately, as if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had not pacified them, they would haue torne one another to pieces. <hi>Sancho</hi> holding still the Goatheard fast, said vnto his Lord, Let mee alone Sir <hi>Knight of the ill fauoured face,</hi> for on this man who is a Clowne as I am my selfe, and dubbed Knight, I may safely satisfie my selfe of the wrong he hath done me, by fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him hand to hand like an honourable man. It is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:173111:128"/> true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but I know well that he is no wise culpable of that which hath hapned. And saying so appeased them; and turned againe to demaund of the Goatheard, whether it were possible to meet again with <hi>Cardenio;</hi> for he remained possessed with an exceeding desire to know the end of his History. The Goatheard turned againe to repeat what he had said at the first, to wit, that he knew not any certaine place of his abode; but if he haunted that Commarke any while, he would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time meete with him; eyther in his madde or modest humour.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:173111:129"/> haue me keepe you company through these desarts night and day, and that I may not speake when I please, is but to bury me aliue: Yet if fortune had so happily disposed our affaires, as that beastes could speake as they did in <hi>Guisopetes</hi> time, the harme had beene lesse, for then would I discourse a while with <hi>Rozinante</hi> (seeing my niggardly fortune hath not consented I might doe it with mine Asse) what I thought good, &amp; in this sort would I weaue my mishaps; for it is a stubborne thing, and that cannot be borne with patience, to trauell all the dayes of our life, and not to encounter any other thing then tramplings vnder feete, tossings in Couerlets, blowes of stones, and buffets, and be besides all this forced to sow vp our mouthes, a man daring not to breake his minde, but to stand mute like a post. <hi>Sancho</hi> I vnderstand thee now, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou diest with longing to speake that which I haue forbidden thee to speake: account therefore that commaundement reuoked, and say what thou pleasest, on condition that this reuocation be onely auaileable and of force whilest we dwell in these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and no longer.</p>
               <p>So be it, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> let me speake now, for what may after befall, God onely knows; and then beginning to take the benefite of his license, he said, I pray you tell me what benefite could you reape by taking Queene <hi>Magimasa?</hi> Or what was it to the purpose that that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat was her friend or no? For if you had let it slip, seeing you were not his Iudge, I verily beleeue that the foole had prosecuted his tale, and we should haue escaped the blow of the stone, the trampling vnder feete and spurnings, yea and more then fiue or sixe good buffets. Yfaith <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> If thou knewest as well as I did how honourable and principall a La. was Queene <hi>Madasima,</hi> thou wouldest rather say, that I had great patience, seeing I did not strike thee on the mouth out of which such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies issued: for it is a very great dishonour to auerre
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173111:129"/> or thinke that any Queene would fall in loue with a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For the truth of the History is, that Master <hi>Elisabat,</hi> of whom the madde man spoke, was very prudent, and a man of a sound iudgement, and serued the Queene as her Tutor &amp; Phisition; but to thinke that she was his I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is a madnesse worthy the seuerest punishment: and to the end thou mayest see that <hi>Cardenio</hi> knew not what he said, thou must vnderstand that when he spoke it, hee then was wholly beside himselfe.</p>
               <p>That's it which I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that you ought not to make account of wordes spoken by a foole; for it fortune had not assisted you, but dressed the stone to your head as it did to your brest, we should haue remained in good plight; for hauing turned so earnestly in that my Ladies defence, whom God confound: and thinke you that <hi>Cardenio</hi> would not escape the dangers of the law, by reason of his madnesse. Any Knight errant, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is bound to turne for the honour of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of what quality soeuer, against mad or vnmad men: How much more for Queenes of so high degree and worth, as was Queene <hi>Madesina,</hi> to whom I beare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affections for her good partes: for besides her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maruellous beautifull, shee was moreouer very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and patient in her calamities, which were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the company and counsels of Master <hi>Elisabat</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued very beneficiall, and necessary to induce her to beare her mishaps with prudence and patience: and hence the ignorant and ill-meaning vulgar tooke occasion to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and affirme, that she was his friend, but I say againe they lie, and all those that doe either thinke or say it, doe lie a thousand times. Why quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I neyther say it nor thinke it; let those affirme any such thing, eate that lie and swallow it with their bread: and if they of whom you spoke, liued lightly, they haue giuen account to God thereof by this. I come from my Vineyard, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I am not a friend to know other mens liues. For
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:173111:130"/> he that byes and lyes shall feele it in his purse. How much more seeing I was borne naked, and am now naked, I can neither win nor lose. And if they were leuyed, what is that for me? And many thinke there is Bacon, and there is but slakes? But how can they set gates to the field, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing they spake ill of God himselfe? Good God, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how many follies hast thou inserted here, and how wide from our purpose are those prouerbs which thou hast recited? Honest <hi>Sancho</hi> hold thy peace, and from henceforth endeauour to serue thy Master, and do not meddle in things which concern thee nothing; &amp; vnderstand with al thy fiue senses, that whatsoeuer I haue done, do, or shall do is wholly guided by reason, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the rules of Knighthood, which I know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the other Knights that euer profest them in the world. Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and is it a good rule of Chiualry, that we goe wandring and lost among these mountains in this sort, without path or way in the search of a mad-man, to whom peraduenture after he is found, will returne a desire to finish what he began, not of his tale, but of your head and my ribbes, by endeuouring to breake them soundly and throughly? Peace I say <hi>Sancho,</hi> once againe, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for thou must wit, that the desire of finding the mad-man alone, brings me not into these parts so much, as that which I haue in my mind to archieue a certaine aduenture, by which I shall acquire eternall renowne and fame, throughout the vniuersall face of the earth: and I shall therewithall seale all that which may render a Knight errant complete and famous. And is the aduenture very dangerous, quoth <hi>Sancho Panca?</hi> No, answered the <hi>Knight of the ill fauoured face,</hi> although the Die might runne in such sort, as we might cast a hazard in steed of an incounter; but all consists in thy diligence. In mine, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Yes (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for if thou returnest speedily from the place whereunto I meane to send thee, my paine will also end
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173111:130"/> shortly, &amp; my glory commence very soone after: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will not hold thee long suspended, awayting to heare the effect of my words, I would haue thee to know, that the famous <hi>Amadis du Gaule,</hi> was one of the most accomplished Knights errant. I do not say well, saying he was one; for he was the onely, the first, the vnike and the Lord of as many as liued in his age. An euill yeare, and a worse moneth for <hi>Don Belianis</hi> or any other that shall dare presume to compare with him; for I sweare that they all are questionlesse deceiued. I also say that when a Painter would become rare and excellent in his arte, he procures to imitate the patternes of the most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Masters of his science. And this very rule runnes currant throughout all other trades and exercises of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which serue to adorne a well disposed Common-wealth; and so ought and doth he that meanes to obtain the name of a prudent and patient man, by imitating <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses,</hi> in whose person and dangers doth <hi>Homer</hi> delineate vnto vs the true portaiture of patience and sufferance; as likewise <hi>Virgil</hi> demonstrates vnder the person of <hi>Eneas,</hi> the duety and valour of a pious sonne, and the sagacity of a hardy and expert Captaine, not shewing them such as indeede they were, but as they should be, to remaine as an example of Vertue, to ensuing posterities. And in this very manner was <hi>Amadis</hi> the North-star, and the <hi>Sunne</hi> of valorous and amorous Knights, whom all we ought to imitate which march vnder the ensignes of loue and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry. And this being so manifest as it is, I finde friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Knight errant who shall imitate him most, shall likewise be neerest to attaine the perfection of armes: and that wherein this Knight bewrayed most his prudence, valour, courage, patience, constancy and loue was when he retyred himselfe to doe penance, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by his Lady <hi>Oriana</hi> to the <hi>Poore Rocke,</hi> changing his name vnto that of <hi>Beltenebros,</hi> a name certainly most significatiue and proper for the life which hee had then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:173111:131"/> willingly chosen. And I may more easily imitate him herein, then in cleauing of <hi>Giants,</hi> beheading of Serpents, killing of Monsters, ouerthrowing of armies, putting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies to flight, and finishing of inchantments. And seeing that this Mountaine is so fit for that purpose, there is no reason why I should ouerslip the occasion, which doth so commodiously proffer me her lockes. In effect, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what is it you mean to do inthese remote places? Haue not I tolde to thee already said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I meane to follow <hi>Amadis,</hi> by playing heere the dispai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wood, and furious man. To imitate likewise the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Orlando</hi> where he found the tokens by a fountaine that <hi>Angelica the faire</hi> had abused her selfe with <hi>Medo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> for griefe whereof he ran mad, and pluckt vp trees by their rootes, troubled the water of cleere fountaines, slew Sheepheards, destroyed their flocks, fired the sheep-folds, ouerthrew houses, trayled Mares after him, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a hundred thousand other insolencies, worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall fame and memory. And although I meane not to imitate <hi>Roldan,</hi> or <hi>Orlando,</hi> or <hi>Rowland</hi> (for hee had all these names) exactly in euery madde prancke which hee played. Yet will I doe it the best I can, in those things which shall seeme vnto me most essentiall. And perhaps I may rest contented with the only imitation of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who without indamaging any by his rauings, &amp; only v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these of feeling laments, arriuing to as great fame therby as any one whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>I beleeue, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Knights which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the like penances, were moued by some reasons to doe the like austerities and follies: but good Sir, what occasion hath beene offered vnto you to become madde? What Lady hath disdained you? Or what arguments haue you found that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso</hi> hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dallied with <hi>Moore</hi> or <hi>Christian?</hi> There is the point, answered our Knight, and therein consists the perfection of mine affaires; for that a Knight errant doe runne mad
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:173111:131"/> vpon any iust occasion, deserues neyther prayse nor thankes: the wit is in waxing madde without cause, whereby my Masters may vnderstand, that if drie, I could doe this, what would I haue done being watered? How much more seeing I haue a iust motiue through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe absence that I haue made from my euer-supremest Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso.</hi> For as thou mightest haue heard read in <hi>Marias Ambrosio</hi> his Sheepheard:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To him that absent is</l>
                  <l>All things succeed amisse.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So that friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I would not haue thee lauish time longer in aduising to let slip so rare, so happy, and singular an imitation. I am madde, and will be madde, vntill thou returne again with answere vpon a letter, which I meane to send with me to my Lady <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> and if it be such as my loyaltie deserues, my madnesse and penance shall end: but if the contrary, I shall runne wood in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and be in that state that I shall apprehend nor feele any thing. So that howsoeuer I be answered, I shall issue out of the conflict and paine wherein thou leauest me, by ioying the good thou shalt bring me, as wise, or not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the euill thou shalt denounce as wood. But tell me <hi>Sancho,</hi> keepest thou charily yet the helmet of <hi>Mambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> which I saw thee take vp from the ground the other day, when that vngrateful fellow thought to haue broken it into pieces, but could not; by which may be collected the excellent temper thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> answered to this demaund, saying, I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or beare longer Sir <hi>Knight of the ill fauoured face,</hi> nor take patiently many things which you say, and I begin to suspect by your words that all that which you haue said to me of <hi>Chiualry,</hi> and of gaining Kingdomes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, of bestowing Ilands and other gifts &amp; great things, as Knights errant are wont, are all matters of ayre and lies, all cousenage or cousening, or how else you please to terme it: for he that shall heare you name a Barbers Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:173111:132"/>
                  <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, and that you will not abandon that errour in more then foure dayes; what other can he thinke, but that he who affirmes such a thing doth want wit and discretion. I carry the Bason in my bagge all battered and bored, and will haue it mended, and dresse my beard in it at home, if God shall doe me the fauor that I may one day see my wife and barnes. Behold <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I doe likewise sweare that thou hast the shallowest pate that euer any Squire had or hath in the world: is it possible, that in all the time thou hast gone with me, thou couldest not perceiue, that all the aduentures of Knights errant doe appeare <hi>Chimeras,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and desperate things, being quite contrary? Not that they are indeed such, but rather by reason that we are still haunted by a crew of inchanters, which chaunge and transforme our actes, making them seeme what they please, according as they like to fauour or annoy vs. And so this which seemes to thee a Barbers bason, is in my conceit <hi>Mambrino</hi> his Helmet; and to another will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in some other shape. And it is doubtlesly done by the profound science of the wiseman my friend, to make that seeme a Bason, which really and truely is <hi>Mambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> helmet: because that it being so precious a Iewell, all the world would pursue me to depriue me of it; but now seeing that it is so like a Barbers bason, they endeuour not to gaine it; as was cleerely shewed in him that thought to breake it the other day, and would not carry it with him, but left it lying behind him on the ground, for yfaith he had neuer left it, did he know the worthinesse thereof. Keepe it friend, for I neede it not at this present wherein I must rather disarme my selfe of the armes I weare, and remaine as naked as I was at the houre of my birth: if I shall take the humour rather to imitate <hi>Orlando</hi> in doing of my penance then <hi>Amadis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst thus he discoursed, he arriued to the foote of a losty mountaine, which stood like a hewen rocke, diuided
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:173111:132"/> from all the rest; by the spirit whereof glided a smooth Riuer hemmed in on euery side by a greene and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meddow, whose verdance did maruellously delight the greedy-beholding eye. There were in it also many wilde trees, and some plants and flowers which rendred the place much more pleasing. <hi>The Knight of the ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured face</hi> made choice of this place to accomplish ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his penance: and therefore as soone as he had viewed it, he began to say with a loud voyce, like a distracted man these words ensuing: This is the place where the humor of mine eyes shall increase the liquid veynes of this Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall current: and my continuall and deepe sighes shall giue perpetuall motion to the leaues of these mountainy trees, in testimony of the paine which my oppressed heart doth suffer. O you, whosoeuer ye be rusticall Gods, which haue your Mansion in this inhabitable place, giue care to the plaints of this vnfortunate louer, whom a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and a few imagined suspitions haue conducted to deplore his state among these desarts; and make him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime on the rough condition of that ingrate and faire, who is the toppe, the Sunne, the period, terme and end of all humane beauty. Oye <hi>Napeas</hi> and <hi>Driades,</hi> which do wontedly inhabite the Thickets and Groues, so may the nimble and lasciuious <hi>Satyres,</hi> by whom (although in vaine) you are beloued, neuer haue power to interrupt your sweete rest, as you shall assist me to lament my disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, or at least attend them whilest I dolefully breath them. O <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> the day of my night, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my paine, North of my trauels, and starre of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: so heauen inrich thee with the highest, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou shalt demaund it, as thou wilt consider the place and passe vnto which thine absence hath conducted me, and answere my faith and desires in compassionate and gracious manner. O solitary trees (which shall from hence forward keepe company with my solitude) giue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens with the soft motion of your bowes, that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:173111:133"/> doth not dislike you. O thou my Squire, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companion in all prosperous and aduerse successes, beare well away, what thou shalt see me doe here, to the end that thou mayest after promptly recount it to the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cause of my ruine. And saying so, he allighted from <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and taking off in a trice his bridle and saddle, he strucke him on the buttocke, saying, He giues thee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that wants it himselfe: O horse, as famous for thy workes as thou art vnfortunate by thy fates. Goe where thou pleasest, for thou bearest written in thy forchead, how that neyther the <hi>Hippogriphon</hi> of <hi>Astolpho,</hi> nor the renowned <hi>Frontino,</hi> which cost <hi>Bradamant</hi> so deerely could compare with thee for swiftnesse.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sancho</hi> had viewed and heard his Lord speake thus, he likewise said, Good betide him that freed vs from the paines of vnpannelling the gray Asse; for if hee were here yfaith he should also haue two or three claps on the buttockes, and a short Oration in his praise: yet if hee were here, I would not permit any other to vnpannell him, seeing there was no occasion why; for he good beast was nothing subiect to the passions of loue, or dispaire no more then I, who was his Master when it pleased God. And in good sooth Sir <hi>Knight of the ill-fauoured face,</hi> if my departure and your madnesse be in good earnest, it will be needfull to saddle <hi>Rozinante</hi> againe, that hee may supply the want of mine Asse; for it will shorten the time of my departure, and returne againe: and if I make my voyage a foote, I know not when I shall arriue there, or returne here backe vnto you; for in good earnest I am a very ill footman. Let it be as thou likest, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for thy designe displeaseth me nothing; and therefore I resolue that thou shalt depart from hence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three dayes, for in the meane space thou shalt beholde what I will doe and say for my Ladies sake, to the end thou maiest tell it to her. Why, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what more can I view, then that which I haue seene already? Thou
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:173111:133"/> art altogether wide of the matter, answered <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> for I must yet teare mine apparrel, throw away mine armour, and strike my head about these rockes, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things of that kinde, that will strike thee into admiration. Let me beseech you, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> see well how you giue your selfe those knockes about the rockes; for you might happen vpon some one so vngracious a rocke, as at the first rappe would dissolue all the whole <hi>Machina</hi> of your aduentures and penance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would be of opinion, seeing that you doe holde it necessary that some knockes be giuen, with the head, and that this enterprise cannot bee accomplished without them, that you content your selfe, seeing that all is but fained, counterfeited, and a iest, that you should, I say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your self with striking it on the water, or on some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soft thing, as Cotton or Wooll, &amp; leaue to my charge the exaggeration thereof, for I will tell to my Ladie that you strike your head against the point of a rocke, which was harder then a Diamond.</p>
               <p>I thanke thee <hi>Sancho</hi> for thy good will, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but I can assure thee that all these things which I doe are no iests, but very serious earnests, for otherwise we should transgresse the Statutes of Chiualry, which commaund vs not to auouch any vntruth, on paine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse, and to doe one thing for another is as much as to lie. So that my head-knockes must be true, firme, and sound ones, without any sophisticall or fantasticall shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: and it will be requisite that thou leaue me some linte to cure me, seeing that fortune hath depriued vs of the <hi>Balsamum</hi> which we lost. It was worse to haue lost the Asse, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> seeing that at once with him we haue lost our linte, and all our other prouision: and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you most earnestly not to name againe that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed drinke, for in onely hearing it mentioned, you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne my guts in me, but also my soule. And I request you moreouer to make account that the terme of three dayes is already expired, wherein you would haue mee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:173111:134"/> take notice of your follies; for I declare them already for seene, and will tell wonders to my Ladie: wherefore go write your Letter, and dispatch me with all hast; for I long already to returne, and take you out of this Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, wherein I leaue you. Dost thou call it a Purgatory <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Thou hadst done better hadst thou called it hell, or rather worse, if there be any thing worse then that. I call it so (quoth <hi>Sancho) quia in inform nulla est retentio,</hi> as I haue heard say. I vnderstand not, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> what <hi>retentio</hi> meaneth. <hi>Retentio</hi> (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> is that, whosoeuer is in hell, neuer comes, nor can come out of it. Which shall fall out contrary in your person, or my feet shall goe ill if I may carry spurs to quicken <hi>Rozinante:</hi> and that I may safely arriue before my Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in <hi>Toboso,</hi> for I will recount vnto her such strange things of your follies and madnesse (for they be all one) that you haue done, and doe daily, as I will make her as soft as a gloue, although I found her at the first harder then a Corke tree: with whose sweet and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie answere I will returne in the aire as speedily as a Witch, and take you out of this Purgatory, which is no hell although it seemes one, seeing there is hope to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape from it; which as I haue said they want which are in hell: and I beleeue you will not contradict me herein. Thou hast reason, answered <hi>the Knight of the ill fauoured face,</hi> but how shall I write the Letter? and the warrant for the receit of the Colts also, added <hi>Sancho.</hi> All shall be inserted together, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> and seeing wee haue no paper, we may doe well, imitating the auncient men of times past, to write our mind in the leaues of trees or waxe; yet waxe is as hard to be found here as paper. But now that I remember my selfe, I know where wee may write our minde well, and more then well, to wit in <hi>Cardenios</hi> Tablets, and thou shalt haue care to cause the letters to be written out againe fairely in the first village, wherein thou shalt finde a Schoole-master; or if such a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173111:134"/> one be wanting, by the Clerke of the Church: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in any sort, that thou giue it not to a Notary or Court-Clerke to bee copied; for they write such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling-confounded processe letter, as <hi>Sathan</hi> himselfe would scarce be able to reade it. And how shall we doe for want of your name and subscription, quoth <hi>Sancho?</hi> Why, answered <hi>Don-Quixote, Amadis</hi> was neuer wont to subscribe to his Letters. I but the warrant to receiue the three Asses must forcibly be subsigned: and if it should afterward be copied, they would say the former is false, and so I shall rest without my Coltes. The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant shall be written and firmed with my hand in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets, which as soone as my Niece shall see, she will make no difficulty to deliuer thee them. And as concerning the loue letter, thou shalt put this subscription to it; <hi>Yours vntill death, the Knight of the ill fauoured face.</hi> And it makes no matter though it be written by any stranger, for as much as I can remember <hi>Dulcinea</hi> can neyther write nor read: nor hath she seene any Letrer, no nor as much as a Character of my writing all the dayes of her life. For my loue and hers haue beene euer <hi>Platonicall,</hi> neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themselues farther, then to an honest regard, and view the one of the other: and euen this same so rarely as I dare boldly sweare, that in these dozen yeares which I loue her more deerely then the light of these mine eyes, which the earth shall one day deuoure, I haue not seene her foure times, and perhaps of those same foure times she hath scarce perceiued once that I beheld her. Such is the care and closenesse wherewithall her parents <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Corcuelo</hi> and her mother <hi>Aldonca Nogales,</hi> haue brought her vp. Ta ta, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> that the Lady <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea of Toboso</hi> is <hi>Lorenco Corchuelo</hi> his daughter, called by another name <hi>Aldonca Lorenco?</hi> The same is shee, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and it is she that merites to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of the vast Vniuerse. I know her very well, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I dare say, that she can throw an Iron barre
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:173111:135"/> as well as any the strongest ladde in our Parish. I vow by the giuer, that tis a wench of the marke tall and stout, and so sturdy withall, that she will bring her chinne out of the mire, in despite of any Knight errant, or that shall erre, that shall honour her as his Lady. Out vpon her, what a strength and voyce she hath? I saw her on a day stand on the toppe of the Church steeple to call certaine seruants of her fathers, that labored in a fallow field; and although they were halfe a league from thence, they heard her as well as if they were at the foote of the Steeple: and the best that is in her is, that she is nothing coy, for she hath a very great smacke of Courtship, and playes with euery one, and gibes and iests at them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And now I affirme Sir <hi>Knight of the ill fauoured face,</hi> that not only you may, and ought to commit rauing follies for her sake, but eke you may with iust title also dispaire and hang your selfe: for none shall heare thereof but will say you did very well, although the Diuell carried you away. And faine would I be gone, if it were for nothing else but to see her: for it is many a day since I saw her, and I am sure she is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this: for womens beauty is much impaired by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies to the fielde, exposed to the Sunne and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I will now <hi>Sir Don-Quixote,</hi> confesse a truth vnto you, that I haue liued vntill now in a maruellous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, thinking well and faithfully that the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was some great Princesse, on whom you were enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or such a person as merited those rich presents which you bestowed on her, as well of the <hi>Biscaines,</hi> as of the Slaues, and many others that ought to be, as I suppose, correspondent to the many victories which you haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both now and in the time that I was not your Squire. But pondering well the matter, I cannot conceiue why the Lady <hi>Aldonca Lorenco;</hi> I meane the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> of these should care whether these vanquished men which you send or shall send, do goe and kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her? For it may befall that she at the very time of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:173111:135"/> their arriuall bee combing of flaxe, or threshing in the barne, whereat they would be ashamed, and she likewise laugh and be somewhat displeased at the present.</p>
               <p>I haue else told thee <hi>Sancho</hi> many times that thou art too great a pratler, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and although thou hast but a grosse witte, yet now and then thy frumps nippe: but to the end thou mayest perceiue the faultinesse of thy braine and my discretion, I will tell thee a short history, which is this: There was once a widdow faire; young, free, rich, and withall very pleasant and io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, that fell in loue with a certaine round and wel-set seruant of a Colledge: his regent came to vnderstand it, and therefore said on a day to the widdow by the way of fraternall correction. Mistresse I do greatly maruell, and not without occasion that a woman so principal, so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and so rich, and specially so wittie, could make so ill a choice, as to waxe enamoured on so foule, so base, and foolish a man as such a one, we hauing in this house so many Masters Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, Graduates, and Diuines, amongst whom you might haue made choise as among Peares, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I will take this, and I will not haue that? But she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him thus, with a very pleasant and good grace; You are Sir greatly deceiued, if you deeme that I haue made an ill choise in such a one, let him seeme neuer so great a foole, for to the purpose that I meane to vse him, he knowes as much or rather more Philosophy then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle.</hi> And so <hi>Sancho</hi> likewise is <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso</hi> as much worth as the highest Princesse of the world, for the effect I meane to vse her. For all the Poets which cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate certaine Ladies at pleasure, thinkest thou that they all had Mistresse? No. Dost thou beleeue that the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis,</hi> the <hi>Files, Siluias, Dianas, Galateas, Alcidas,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers such like, wherewithall the bookes, ditties, Barbers shops, and Theaters are filled, were truely Ladies of flesh and bones, and their Mistresses which haue and doe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate them thus? No certainly, but were for the greater
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:173111:136"/> part fained, to serue as a subiect of their verses, to the end the authours might be accounted amorous, and men of courage enough to be such. And thus it is also sufficient for me to beleeue and thinke that the good <hi>Aldonca Lorenco</hi> is faire and honest: as for her parentage it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters but little; for none will send to take information thereof, to giue to her an habite; and I make account of her as of the greatest Princesse in the world. For thou oughtest to know <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou knowest it not already, that two things alone incite man to loue more then all things else, and those be surpassing beauty, and a good name. And both these things are found in <hi>Dulcinea</hi> in their prime: for none can equall her in fairenesse, and few come neere her for a good report. And for a finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, I imagine that all that which I say, is really so, without adding or taking ought away. And I doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine her in my fantasie to be such, as I could wish her as well in beauty as principality: and neyther can <hi>Helen</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, nor <hi>Lucrece</hi> come neere her, no nor any of those other famous women, Greeke, Barbarous, or Latine, of forgoing ages. And let euery one say what he pleaseth; for though I should be reprehended for this by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet shall I not therfore be chastised by the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant and rigorous sort of men. I auouch, quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> that you haue great reason in all that you say, and that I am my selfe a very Asse. But alas why doe I name an Asse with my mouth, seeing one should not make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Rope in ones house that was hanged? But giue me the letter, and farewell, for I will change. With that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> drew out his Tablets, and going a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side he began to indite his Letter with a great grauity; and hauing ended it, called <hi>Sancho</hi> to him and said, that he would reade it to him, to the end he might beare it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in memory, lest by chance he did lose the Tablets on the way, for such were his crosse fortunes, as made him feare euery euent. To which <hi>Sancho</hi> answered, saying,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:173111:136"/> write it there twise or thrise in the booke, and giue me it after; for I will carry it safely by Gods grace. For to thinke that I will be euer able to take by rote is a great folly; for my memory is so short, as I doe many times forget mine owne name. But yet for all that reade it to me good Sir, for I would be glad to heare it, as a thing which I suppose to be as excellent, as if it were cast in a mould. Heare it then, sayes <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for thus it sayes.</p>

               <p>By my fathers life, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> when hee heard the Letter, it is the highest thing that euer I heard in my life.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173111:137"/> Good God, and how well doe you say euery thing in it, and how excellently haue you applyed the subscription of <hi>the Knight of the ill fauoured face!</hi> I say againe in good earnest, that you are the Diuell himselfe, and there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but you know it. All is necessary answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for the office that I professe. Put then (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> in the other side of that leafe, the warrant of the three Coults, and firme it with a leagible letter, that they may know it at the first sight. I am pleased, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and so writing it, he read it after to <hi>Sancho,</hi> and it said thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You shall please good Niece, for this first of Colts to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto my Squire</hi> Sancho Panca, <hi>three of the fiue that I left at home, and are in your charge: the which three Colts I commaund to bee deliuered to him, for as many others counted and receiued here, for with this, and his acquitance they shall be iustly deliuered. Giuen in the bowels of Sierra Morena, the two and twentieth of August, of this present yeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It goes very well (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> subsigne it therefore I pray you. It needes no seale (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but onely my Rubricke, which is as valible as if it were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, not onely for three Asses, but also for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. My trust is in you, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> permit mee, for I will goe saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and prepare your selfe to giue me your blessing, for I purpose presently to depart before I see any madde pranke of yours; for I will say that I saw you play so many, as no more can be desired. I will haue thee stay <hi>Sancho</hi> (and that because it is requisite) at least to see me starke naked, playing a douzen or two of rauing trickes, for I will dispatch them in lesse then halfe an houre; because that thou hauing viewed them with thine owne eyes, mayest safely sweare al the rest that thou pleasest to adde; and I assure thee that thou canst not tell so many as I meane to performe. Let me intreate you good Sir, that I may not see you naked, for it wil turne my
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:173111:137"/> stomacke, and I shall not be able to keepe my selfe from weeping: and my head is yet so sore since yesternight through my lamentations, for the losse of the gray beast, as I am not strong enough yet to endure new plaints: but if your pleasure be such, as I must necessarily see some follies: doe them in Ioues name in your clothes briefely, and such as are most necessarie. Chiefly seeing none of these things were requisite for me; and as I haue said, we might excuse time (that shall now be lauished in these trifles) to returne speedily with the newes you desire and deserue so much. And if not, let the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide her selfe well; for if she answere not according to reason, I make a solemne vow to him that I may, that Ile make her disgorge out of her stomacke a good answere, with very kickes and fists. For how can it be suffered that so famous a Knight errant as your self should thus run out of his wits, without, nor for what, for one? Let not the Gentlewoman constraine me to say the rest, for I will out with it, &amp; venter all vpon twelue, although it neuer were solde.</p>
               <p>In good faith <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> I thinke thou art growen as madde as my selfe. I am not so mad, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I am more cholerick. But setting that aside, say what will you eate vntill my returne? Doe you meane to doe as <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and take by the high waies side perforce from the Sheepheards? Care thou not for that, replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for although I had it, yet would I not eate any other thing then the hearbes and fruits that this field and trees doe yeeld; for the perfection of mine affaire consists in fasting, and the exercise of other castiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To this <hi>Sancho</hi> replied, Doe you know what I feare? That I shall not finde the way to you againe heere where I leaue you, it is so difficult and obscure. Take well the markes, and I will endeauour to keepe hereabouts, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> vntill thou come backe againe: and will moreouer about the time of thy returne mount to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:173111:138"/> the tops of these high Rockes, to see whether thou appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: but thou shouldest doe best of all, to the end thou maiest not stay and misse me, to cut downe here and there certain boughes, and strow them on the way as thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, vntill thou beest out in the plaines, and those may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serue thee as bounds and marks, by which thou mayst againe finde me when thou returnest, in imitation of the clew of <hi>Theses</hi> Labyrinth. I wil doe so, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> and then cutting downe certaine boughes, he demanded his Lords blissing, and departed not without teares on both sides. And mounting vpon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> whō <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> commended very seriously to his care, that he should ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as he would his owne person, hee made on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the plaines, strowing here and there on the way his branches, as his Master had aduised him; and with that departed, although his Lord importuned him to beholde two or three follies ere he went away. But scarce had he gone a hundred paces, when he returned and said, I say Sir that you said wel, that to the end I might sweare with a safe conscience that I haue seene you play these madde trickes, it were necessary that at least I see you doe one, although that of your abode here is one great enough. Did not I tell thee so, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> stay <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I will doe it in the space of a Creede; and taking off with all hast his hose, he remained the halfe of him naked, and did instantly giue two or three ierkes in the aire, and two tumbles ouer and ouer on the ground, with his head downeward and his legges aloft, where hee discouered such things as <hi>Sancho,</hi> because he would not see them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, turned the bridle and rode away, resting contented and satisfied, that he might swear that his Lord was mad. And so we will leaue him trauelling on his way, vntil his returne, which was very soone after.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein are prosecuted the pranckes played by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his amorous humors, in the mountains of Sierra Morena.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND turning to recount what <hi>the Knight of the ill fauoured face</hi> did when he was all alone, the History sayes that after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had ended his friskles and leaps, naked from the gyrdle downward, and from that vpward apparrelled; seeing that his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> was gone, and would behold no more of his madde pranckes; hee ascended to the toppe of a high rocke, and began there to thinke on that whereon he had thought oftentimes before, without euer making a full resolution therein, to wit, whether were it better to imitate <hi>Orlando</hi> in his vnmeasurable furies, then <hi>Amadis</hi> in his melancholy moods: &amp; speaking to himselfe, would say; if <hi>Orlando</hi> was so valorous and good a Knight, as men say; what wonder, seeing in fine he was inchanted and could not be slaine, if it were not by a denier pinne, thrust in at the sole of his foote; and therefore did weare shooes still, that had seuen foulds of Iron in the soles: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these his draughts stood him in no steede at <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesuales</hi> against <hi>Bernardo del Carpio,</hi> which vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, pressed him to death betweene his armes. But leauing his valour apart, let vs come to the losing of his wits; which it is certaine he lost through the signes hee found in the Forrest, and by the newes that the Sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard gaue vnto him, that <hi>Angelica</hi> had slept more then two noonetydes with the little <hi>Moore Medoro</hi> of the curled lockes, him that was Page to King <hi>Agramante:</hi> and if he vnderstood this, and knew his Lady had played beside the cushion, what wonder was it that hee should
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:173111:139"/> runne madde? But how can I imitate him in his furies, if I cannot imitate him in their occasion; for I dare fweare for my <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> that all the dayes of her life she hath not seene one <hi>Moore,</hi> euen in his owne attire as he is, and she is now right as her mother bore her: and I should doe her a manifest wrong, if vpon any false suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I should turne madde, of that kinde of folly that did distract furious <hi>Orlando.</hi> On the other side I see that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis du Gaule,</hi> without loosing his wits or vsing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rauing tricke, gained as great fame of being amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as any one else whatsoeuer. For that which his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie recites was none other, then that seeing himselfe disdained by his Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> who had commaunded him to withdraw himselfe from her presence, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare againe in it, vntill she pleased: he retired himselfe in the company of a certaine Hermit to the poore rocke, and there crammed himselfe with weeping, vntill that heauen assisted him in the midst of his greatest cares and necessitie. And this being true, as it is, why should I take now the paines to strip my selfe all naked, and offend these trees, which neuer yet did me any harme? Nor haue I any reason to trouble the cleer waters of these brooks, which must giue me drinke when I am thirsty. Let the remembrance of <hi>Amadis</hi> liue, and be imitated in euery thing as much as may be by <hi>Don-Quixote of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha:</hi> of whom may be said, what was said of the other, that though he atchieued not great things, yet did he die in their pursuit. And though I am not contemned or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daired by my <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> yet it is sufficient as I haue said already, that I be absent from her: therefore handes to your taske, and ye famous actions of <hi>Amadis</hi> occurre to my remembrance, and instruct me where I may best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to imitate you. Yet I know already that the greatest thing he did vse was prayer, and so will I. And saying so, he made him a paire of Beades of great Gaules, and was very much vexed in minde for want of an Eremite, who
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:173111:139"/> might heare his confession, and comfort him in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore did entertaine himselfe walking vp and downe the little greene fielde, writing and grauing in the rindes of trees, and on the smooth sandes many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all accommodated to his sadnesse, and some of them in the praise of <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> But those that were found throughly finished, and were ledgible after his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againe in that place, were onely these ensuing.</p>

               <p>The addition of <hi>Toboso</hi> to the name of <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> did not cause small laughter in those which found the verses reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because they imagined that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> conceiued, that if in the naming of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> he did not also adde that <hi>Of Toboso,</hi> the rime could not be vnderstood; and in truth it was so, as he himselfe did afterward confesse. He cōposed many others, but as we haue related none could be well copied, or found intire but these three stanza's. In this, and in sighing, and inuoking the <hi>Faunes</hi> and <hi>Siluanes</hi> of these woods, &amp; the <hi>Nymphes</hi> of the adioyning streams, with the dolorous and hollow <hi>Eccho,</hi> that it would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and they consort and listen vnto him; and in the search of some hearbes to sustaine his languishing forces; he intertained himselfe al the time of <hi>Sancho</hi> his absence: who had be staied three weekes away, as he did but three dayes, <hi>The Knight of the ill fauoured face</hi> should haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained so disfigured, as the very mother that bore him would not haue knowne him.</p>
               <p>But now it is congruent that leauing him swallowed in the gulphes of sorrow and versifying, we turne &amp; recount what hapned to <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> in his Embassage; which was that issuing out to the high way, he presently tooke that, which ledde towards <hi>Toboso,</hi> and arriued the next day following to the Inne, where the disgrace of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlet befell him: and scarce had he well espied it, but presently he imagined that he was once againe flying in the ayre, and therefore would not enter into it, although his arriuall was at such an houre, as he both might and ought to haue stayed, being dinner time, and he himselfe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:173111:140"/> likewise possest with a maruellous longing to taste some warme meate; for many dayes past he had fedde altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on colde viands. This desire inforced him to approch to the In, remaining still doubtfull notwithstanding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should enter into it or no. And as he stood thus suspended, there issued out of the Inne twopersons, which presently knew him, and the one faid to the other, tell me Master Licenciat, is not that horseman that rides there <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> him whom our aduenturers olde woman said to depart with her Master for his Squire? It is quoth the Licenciat, &amp; that is our <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his horse: and they knew him thus well, as those that were the Curate and Barber of his own village; and were those that made the search and formall processe against the bookes of Chiualry: and therefore as soone as they had taken full notice of <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> and <hi>Rozinante,</hi> desirous to learne newes of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they drew neere vnto him, and the Curate called him by his name, saying, friend <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> where is your Master? <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> knew them instantly, and desirous to conceale the place and manner wherein his Lord remained, did answere them that his Master was in a certaine place with-held by affaires for a few daies, that were of great consequence and concerned him very much, and that hee durst not for both his eyes discouer the place to them. No, no (quoth the Barber) <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> if thou dost not tell vs where hee soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, we must imagine as we doe already, that thou hast rob'd and slaine him, specially seeing thou commest thus on his horse; and therefore thou must in good faith get vs the horses owner, or else stand to thine answere. Your threats feare me nothing, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am not a man that robs or murthers any one, euery man is slaine by his destinie, or by God that made him. My Lord remaines doing of penance in the midst of this mountaine, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great pleasure. And then he presently recounted vnto them, from the beginning to the end the fashion wherein
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:173111:141"/> he had left him; the aduentures which had befalne, and how he carried a Letter to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> who was <hi>Lorenco Corchuelo</hi> his daughter, of whom his Lady was enamoured vp to the liuers.</p>
               <p>Both of them stood greatly admired at <hi>Sanchoes</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and although they knew <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madnesse already, and the kinde thereof, yet as often as they heard speake thereof they rested newly amazed. They reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Sancho</hi> to shew them the letter that he caried to the Lady <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso.</hi> He told them that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Tablets, and that he had expresse order from his Lord to haue it fairely copied out in paper, at the first vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage whereunto he should arriue. To which the Curate answered, bidding shew it vnto him, and he would write out the copie very fairly. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> thrust his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bosome, and searched the little booke, but could not finde it, nor should not though hee had searched till Doomes day, for it was in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> power, who gaue it not to him, nor did he euer remember to demaund it. When <hi>Sancho</hi> perceiued that the booke was lost, his visage waxed as pale and wanne as a dead man, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe very speedily to feele all the parts of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he saw cleerely that it could not be found, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without making any more adoe, he laid, holde on his owne beard with both his fiftes, and drew almost the one halfe of the haire away, and afterward bestowed on his face and nose in a <hi>memento</hi> halfe a douzen such cuffes, as he bathed them all in bloud; which the Curate and Barber beholding, they asked of him, what had befalne him, that he intreated himselfe so ill? what should befall me answered <hi>Sancho?</hi> But that I haue lost at one hand, and in an instant three Colts, whereof the least was like a Castle. How so, quoth the Barber? Marry said <hi>Sancho</hi> I haue lost the Tablets wherein were written <hi>Dulcineas</hi> Letter, and a schedule of my Lords, addrest to his Niece, wherein he commaunded her to deliuer vnto me three
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:173111:141"/> Colts, of foure or fiue that remained in his house. And saying so, hee recounted the losse of his gray Asse: The Curate comforted him, and said, that as soone as his Lord were found, he would deale with him to renew his grant, and write it in paper, according to the common vse and practise; for as much as those which were written in Tablets were inualid, and would neuer be accepted, nor accomplished. With this <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke courage, and said, if that was so he cared not much for the losse of <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> Letter; for he knew it almost all by rote. Say it then <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth the Barber, and we will after write it. Then <hi>Sancho</hi> stood still, and began to scratch his head, to call the letter to memory, and now would he stand vpon one legge, and now vpon another. Sometimes he looked on the earth, others vpon heauen, and after he had gnawen off almost the halfe of one of his nailes and held them all the while suspended, expecting his recitall thereof, he said after a long pause: On my soule, Master Licenciat, I giue to the Diuell any thing that I can remember of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although the beginning was thus; <hi>High and vnsauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Ladie:</hi> I warrant you, quoth the Barber, he said not so, but <hi>Super humaine</hi> or <hi>Soueraigne Ladie.</hi> It is so, quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and presently followed, if I well remember, <hi>He that is wounded and wants sleepe, and the hurt man doth kisse your worships hands, ingrate and very scornefull faire.</hi> And thus he went rouing vntill he ended in. <hi>Yours vntill death, the Knight of the ill fauoured face.</hi> Both of them tooke great delight to see <hi>Sanchos</hi> good memory, and praysed it to him very much, and requested him to repeat the Letter once or twice more to them, that they might also beare it in memorie, to write it at the due season. <hi>Sancho</hi> turned to recite it againe and againe, and at euery repetition said other three thousand errours. And after this he tolde other things of his Lord, but spoke not a word of his owne tossing in a Couerlet, which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne him in that Inne, into which he refused to enter. He
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173111:142"/> added besides, how his Lord in bringing him a good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch from his Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> of <hi>Toboso,</hi> would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with set out to endeauour how he might become an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or at the least a Monarch; for they had so agreed betweene themselues both: and it was a very easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to become one, such was the valour of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and strength of his arme. And that when hee were one, he would procure him a good marriage; for by that time he should be a widdower at the least. And he would giue him one of the Emperours Ladies to wife, that were an Inheretrix of some great and rich state on the firme land, for now he would haue no more Islands. And all this was related so seriously by <hi>Sancho,</hi> and so in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sense, he scratching his nose euer and anon as hee spoke; so as the two were strucken into a new amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pondering the vehemencie of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which caried quite away with it in that sort the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that poore man, but would not labour to dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse him of that errour, because it seemed to them that since it did not hurt his conscience, it was better to leaue him in it, that the recital of his follies might turne to their greater recreation: and therefore exhorted him to pray for the health of his Lord; for it was a very possible and contingent thing to arriue in the discourse of time to the dignity of an Emperour, as he said, or at least to that of an Archbishop, or other calling equiualent to it.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sancho</hi> demanded of them, Sirs, if fortune should turne our affaires to another course, in such sort, as my Lord abandoning the purpose to purchase an Empire, would take in his head that of becomming a Cardinall, I would faine learne of you heere, what Cardinall errants are wont to giue to their Squires? They are wont to giue them (quoth the Curate) some simple Benefice, or some Parsonage, or to make them Clerkes or Sextons, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of some Church, whose liuing amounts to a good penny rent, beside the profite of the Altar, which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:173111:142"/> as much more: for that it is requisite (quoth <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho)</hi> that the Squire be not married, and that he know how to helpe Masse at least: and if that be so vnfortunate, I, that both am married, and knowes not besides the first letter of the A. B. C. What will then become of me, if my Master take the humour to be an Archbishop, and not an Emperour, as is the custome and vse of Knights errant? Doe not afflict thy minde for that friend <hi>Sancho</hi> (quoth the Barber) for we will deale with thy Lord heere, and we will counsaile him, yea we wil vrge it to him as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conscience, that he become an Emperour, and not an Archbishop; for it will be more easie for him to bee such a one, by reason that he is more valorous then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So me thinkes (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> although I know he hath ability enough for all. That which I meane to doe for my part is, I will pray vnto our Lord to conduct him to that place, wherein he may serue him best, and giue me greatest rewardes. Thou speakest like a discreet man (quoth the Curate) and thou shalt doe therein the duetie of a good Christian. But that which we must endeuour now, is to deuise how we may winne thy Lord from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting that vnprofitable penance hee hath in hand, as thou sayest: And to the end we may thinke on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, and eate our dinner withall, seeing it is time, let vs all enter into the Inne. <hi>Sancho</hi> bad them goe in and he would stay for them at the doore, and that he would after tell them the reason why he had no minde to enter, neither was it in any sort conuenient that he should: but he intreated them to bring him somewhat forth to eate, that were warme, and some prouand for <hi>Rozinante.</hi> With that they departed into the lodging, and within a while after the Barber brought forth vnto him some meate: and the Curate and Barber, after hauing pondered well with themselues what course they were to take to attaine their designe. The Curate fel on a deuice very fit both for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour, and also to bring their purpose
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:173111:143"/> to passe; and was as he tolde the Barber, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him, to apparrell himselfe like a Lady aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and that he therefore should doe the best that hee could to fit himselfe like a Squire, and that they would go in that habite to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, fayning that fhe was an afflicted and distressed Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, and would demaund a boone of him, which hee as a valorous Knight errant would in no wise denie her; and that the gift which he meaned to desire, was to intreate him to follow her where she would carry him, to right a wrong which a naughtie Knight had done vnto her: and that she would besides pray him not to commaund her to vnmaske her selfe, or inquire any thing of her estate, vntill he had done her right, against that badde Knight. And by this meanes he certainely hoped, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would graunt all that he requested in this manner. And in this sort they would fetch him from thence, and bring him to his village, where they would labour with al their power, to see whether his extrauagaut frensie could be recouered by any remedy.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Curate and the Barber put their designe in practise, with many other things, worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in this famous Historie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Curates inuention disliked not the Barber, but rather pleased him so well, as they presently put it in execution. They borrowed therfore of the Inkeepers wife a Gowne and a Kerchife, leauing her in pawne therof a faire new Cassocke of the Curates. The Barber made him a great beard of a pyed Oxes tayle, wherein the Inkeeper was wont to hang his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:173111:143"/> Horse-combe. The Hostesse demaunded of them the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion why they would vse these things? The Curate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in briefe reasons of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madnesse, and how that disguisement was requisite, to bring him away from the mountaine, wherein at that present he made his abode. Presently the Inkeeper and his wife remembred themselues how he had beene their guest, and of his <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum,</hi> and was the tossed Squires Lord; and then they rehearsed againe to the Curate all that had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene him and them in that Inne, without omitting the accident that had befalne <hi>Sancho</hi> himselfe; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion the Hostesse tricked vp the Curate so handsomly, as there could be no more desired: for she attired him in a gowne of broad-cloth, laid ouer with guardes of blacke Veluet, euery one being of a span breadth, full of gashes and cuts: the bodies and sleeues of greene Veluet, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with white Sattin: which gowne and doublet as I suspect were both made in the time of King <hi>Bamba.</hi> The Curate would not permit them to vaile and bekerchife him, but set on his head a white-quilted-linuen-night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap; which he carried for the night, and guirded his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with a blacke Taffata garter, and with the other he masked his face, wherewithall he couered his beard and visage very neatly. Then did he incaske his pate in his hat, which was so broad, as it might serue him excellently for a <hi>Quitafoli,</hi> and lapping himselfe vp handsomly in his long cloke, he went to horse, and rode as women vse. Then mounted the Barber likewise on his Mule, with his beard hanging downe to the gyrdle, halfe red and halfe white, as that which as wee haue said was made of the taile of a pyed coloured Oxe: then taking leaue of them all, and of the good <hi>Maritornes,</hi> who promised (although a sinner) to say a rosary to their intention, to the end that God might giue them good successe, in so Christian and difficult an aduenture, as that which they vndertooke. But scarce were they gone out of the Inne, when the Curate
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:173111:144"/> began to dread a little that he had done ill, in apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himselfe in that wise, accounting it a very indecent thing that a Priest should dight himselfe so, although the matter concerned him neuer so much. And acquainting the Barber with his surmise, he intreated him that they might change attires, seeing it was much more iust that he, because a lay-man, should faine the oppressed Ladie, and himselfe would become his Squire, for so his dignity would be lesse prophaned: to which if he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend, he resolued to passe on no farther, although the Diuell should carie therefore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> away. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> came ouer to them about this season; and seeing of them in that habite, he could not containe his laughter. The Barber to bee briefe did all that which the Curate pleased, and making thus an exchange of inuentions, the Curate instructed him how he should behaue himselfe; and what wordes he should vse to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to presse and moue him to come away with him, and forsake the propension and loue to that place, which he had chosen to performe his vaine penance. The Barber answered that he would set euery thing in his due point and perfection, though he had neuer lessoned him; but would not set on the array, vntill they came neere to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> abode, and therfore folded vp his clothes, and Master Parson his beard, and forthwith went on their way, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> playing the guide; who recounted at large to them all that had hapned with the mad-man, whom they found in the mountaine; concealing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the booty of the Malet, with the other things found therein: for although otherwise most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet was our yong man an ordinary vice of fooles, and had a spice of couetousnesse.</p>
               <p>They arriued the next day following to the place where <hi>Sancho</hi> had left the tokens of boughes, to finde that wherein his Master soiourned: and hauing taken notice thereof, he said vnto them that, that was the entry,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:173111:144"/> and therfore they might do well to apparrell themselues, if by change that might be a meane to procure his Lords libertie; for they had tolde him already, that on their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and apparrelling in that manner, consisted wholly the hope of freeing his Lord, out of that wretched life he had chosen; and therefore did charge him on his life not to reueale to his Lord in any case what they were, nor seeme in any sort to know them: and that if he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as they were sure he would) whether he had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his letter to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> he should say that he did, and that by reason she could not reade, she answered him by word of mouth, saying, that she commanded vnder paine of her indignation, that presently abandoning so austere a life, he would come and see her; for this was most requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, to the end that moued therwithall, and by what they meant likewise to say vnto him, they made certaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to reduce him to a better life, and would besides perswade him to that course instantly, which might set him in the way how to become an Emperor or Monark; for as concerning the being an Archbishop, hee needed not to feare it at all. <hi>Sancho</hi> listened to all the talke and instructions, and bore them away well in memory and gaue them great thankes for the intention they had to counsell his Lord to become an Emperour, and not an Archbishop: for as he said, hee imagined in his simple iudgement that an Emperours were of more ability to reward their Squires then an Archbishops errant. Hee likewise added that he thought it were necessary he went somewhat before them to search him, and deliuer his Ladies answere: for perhaps it alone would be sufficient to fetch him out of that place, without putting them to any further paines. They liked of <hi>Sancho Pancas</hi> deuice, and therefore determined to expect him, vntil his returne with the newes of finding his Master. With that <hi>Sancho</hi> entred in by the clifts of the rockes (leauing them both behinde together) by which ran a little smooth streame,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:173111:145"/> to which other Rockes and some trees that grew neere vnto it, made a fresh and pleasing shaddow. The heates, and the day wherein they arriued there, was one of those of the moneth of August, when in those places the heate is intollerable: the houre, about three in the afternoone. All which did render the place more grateful, and inuited them to remaine therein vntill <hi>Sanchoes</hi> returne. Both therefore arresting there quietly vnder the shadow, there arriued to their hearing the sound of a voyce, which without being accompanied by any instrument, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound so sweet and melodiously, as they remained great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired, because they esteemed not that to be a place wherein any so good a Musitian might make his abode. For although it is vsually said that in the woods and fields are found Shepheards of excellent voyces, yet is this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Poetical indeerement, then an approued truth; and most of a I when they perceiued that the verses they heard him singing were not of rusticke composition, but rather of delicate and Courtly inuention. The truth whereof is confirmed by the verses, which were these:</p>

               <p>The houre, the time, the solitarines of the place, voice, and arte of him that sung, strucke wonder and delight in the hearers mindes, which remained still quiet, listning whether they might heare any thing else: but perceiuing that the silence continued a pretie while, they agreed to issue and seeke out the Musitian, that sung so harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. And being ready to put their resolution in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, they were againe arrested by the same voyce; the which touched their cares anew with this Sonnet.</p>

               <p>The song was concluded with a profound sigh; and both the others lent attentiue eare to heare if hee would sing any more; but perceiuing that the musicke was conuerted into throbs and dolefull plaints, they resolued to goe and learne who was the wretch, as excellent for his voyce, as dolorous in his sighes: and after they had gone a little at the doubling of the point of a cragge, they perceiued one of the very same forme and fashion that <hi>Sancho</hi> had painted vnto them, when he tolde them the History of <hi>Cardenio:</hi> which man espying them likewise, shewed no semblance of feare, but stood stil with his head hanging on his brest like a malecontent, not once lifting vp his eyes to behold them from the first time, when they vnexpectedly arriued.</p>
               <p>The Curate who was a man very well spoken (as one that had already intelligence of his misfortune, for hee knew him by his signes) drew neerer to him, and prayed and perswaded him with short, but very forcible reasons, to forsake that miserable life, lest he should there eternally lose it, which of all miseries would proue the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Cardenio</hi> at this season was in his right sense, free from the furious accident, that distracted him so often; and therefore viewing them both attired in so strange and vnusuall a fashion from that which was vsed among those desarts, he rested somewhat admired; but chiefely hearing them speake in his affaire, as in a matter knowne (for so much he gathered out of the Curates speeches) and therefore answered in this manner: I perceiue well, good Sirs (whosoeuer you be) that heauen which hath alwayes care to succour good men, yea euen and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:173111:146"/> many times, hath without any desert addrest vnto me by these desarts and places so remote from vulgar haunt, persons, which laying before mine eyes with quicke and pregnant reasons the little I haue to leade this kinde of life, doe labour to remoue me from this place to a better: and by reason they know not as much as I doe, and that after escaping this harme, I shall fall into a farre greater, they account me perhaps for a man of weake discourse, and what is worse for one wholly deuoide of iudgement. And were it so, yet is it no maruell; for it seemes to me that the force of the imagination of my disasters is so bent and powerfull in my destruction, that I without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make it any resistance, do become like a stone, voyde of all good feeling and knowledge: and I come to know the certainty of this truth, when some men doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and shew vnto me tokens of the things I haue done, whilest this terrible accident ouer rules me: and after I can doe no more, then be grieued though in vaine, and curse without benefite my too froward fortune; and render as an excuse of my madnesse, the relation of the cause thereof, to as many as please to heare it: for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men perceiuing the cause, will not wonder at the effects. And though they hiue me no remedie, yet at least wil not condemne me, for it will conuert the anger they conceiue at my misrules, into compassion of my disgraces. And Sirs if by chance it be so, that you come with the same intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that others did, I request you ere you inlarge farther your discreet perswasions, that you will giue eare a while to the relation of my mishaps: for perhaps when you haue vnderstood it, you may saue the labour that you would take, conforting an euill wholly incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
               <p>Both of them which desired nothing so much then to vnderstand from his owne mouth, the occasion of his harmes, did intreate him to relate it, promising to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in his remedie or comfort, but what himselfe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:173111:147"/> pleased. And with this the sorrowfull Gentleman began his dolefull Historie, with the very same wordes almost that he had rehearsed it to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard a few dayes past, when by occasion of Master <hi>Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat</hi> and <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> curiositie in obseruing the <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of Chiualry, the tale remained imperfect, as our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story left it aboue. But now good fortune so disposed things, that his foolish fit came not vpon him, but gaue him leisure to continue his storie to the end; and so arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the passage that spoke of the Letter <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> found in the booke of <hi>Amadis du Gaule, Cardento</hi> said that he had it very well in memory; and the sense was this.</p>

               <p>This Letter moued me to demand <hi>Luscinda</hi> of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my wife, as I haue already recounted; and by it also <hi>Luscinda</hi> remained in <hi>Don Ferdinandos</hi> opinion crowned, for one of the most discreete women of her time. And this billet Letter was that which first put him in minde to destroy me, e're I could effect my desires. I tolde to <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> wherein consisted all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of her fathers protracting of the marriage; to wit, in that my father should first demaund her; the which I dared not to mention vnto him, fearing lest hee would not willingly consent therunto; not for that the qualitie, bountie, vertue, and beautie of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> were to him
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:173111:147"/> vnknowne, or that she had not partes in her able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noblish and adorne any other linage of Spaine whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but because I vnderstood by him that he desired not to marrie me vntill hee had seene what Duke <hi>Ricardo</hi> would doe for me. Finally, I tolde him that I dared not reueale it to my father, as well for that inconnenience, as for many others that made me so affraid, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they were, as me thought my desires would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take effect. To all this <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> made me an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that he would take vpon him to speake to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and perswade him to treate of that affaire also with <hi>Luscindas.</hi> O ambitious <hi>Marius.</hi> O eruell <hi>Cataline.</hi> O facinorous <hi>Quila.</hi> O treacherous <hi>Galalon.</hi> O trayterous <hi>Ʋellido.</hi> O reuengefull <note n="*" place="margin">One who for the rape of his daughter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi> King of Spaine, brought in the Moores and destroyed all the Countrey.</note>
                  <hi>Iulian.</hi> O conetous <hi>Iudas.</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, cruell, reuengefull, and cousening, what indeserts did this wench commit, who with such plaines discouered to thee the secrets and delights of his heart? What offence committed I against thee? What words did I speake, or counsel did I giue, that were not all addrest to the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of thine honour and profite? But on what doe I of all wretches the worst complaine, seeing that when the current of the starres do bring with it mishaps; by reason they come downe precipitarely from aboue, there is no earthly force can with-hold, or humane industry preuent or euacunt them? Who would haue imagined that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> a noble Gentleman, discreete, obliged by my deserts, and powerfull to obtaine whatsoeuer the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous desire would exact of him, where and whensoeuer it seazed on his heart (would as they say) become so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as to depriue me of one onely sheepe, which yet I did not possesse? But let these considerations be laide apart as vnprofitable, that we may knit vp againe the broken threede of my vnfortunate History. And therefore I say, that <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> beleeuing that my presence was a hinderance to put his treacherous and wicked designe in execution, he resolued to send me to his eldest brother,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:173111:148"/> vnder pretext to get some money of him, for to buy sixe great horses, that he had of purpose, and onely to the end I might absent my selfe, bought the very same day that he offered to speake himselfe to my father, and would haue me goe for the money (because he might bring his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous intent the better to passe) could I preuent this treason? Or could I perhaps but once imagin it? No tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but rather glad for the good merchandize hee had made, did make proffer of my selfe to depart for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney very willingly. I spoke that night to <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and acquainted her with the agreement past betweene mee and <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> bidding her to hope firmely that our good iust desires would sort a wished and happie end. She answered me againe (as little suspecting <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandos</hi> treason as my selfe) bidding me to returne with all speede, because she beleeued that the conclusion of our affections should be no longer deferred, then my father deferred to speake vnto hers. And what was the cause I know not, but as soone as she had said this vnto me, her eyes were filled with teares, and somewhat thwarting her throate, hindered her from saying many other things, which me thought she striued to speake.</p>
               <p>I rested admired at this new accident vntill that time neuer seene in her: for alwaies as many times as my good fortune and diligence graunted it, we conuersed with all sport and delight, without euer intermedling in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, any teares, sighes, complaints, suspitions, or fears. All my speech was to aduance my fortune; for hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued her from heauen as my Ladie and Mistresse, then would I amplifie her beautie, admire her worth, &amp; praise her discretion. She on the other side would returne mee the exchange, extolling in me, what she as one enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accounted worthy of laude and commendation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this we would recount a hundred thousand toyes and chaunces befalne our neighbours and acquaintance, and that to which my presumption dared farthest to extend it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:173111:148"/> selfe, was sometimes to take her beautifull and Iuorie hands perforce, and kisse them as well as I might through the rigorous strictnesse of a niggardly Iron grate which deuided vs. But the precedent night to the day of my sad departure, she wept, sobd, and sighed, and departed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me full of confusion and inward assaults, amazed to beholde such new and dolefull tokens of sorrow and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Luscinda.</hi> But because I would not murder my hopes, I did attribute all these things to the force of her affection towards me, and to the griefe which absence is wont to stirre in those that loue one another deerely. To be briefe, I departed from thence sorrowfull and pensiue, my soule being ful of imaginations and suspitions, and yet know not what I suspected or imagined. Cleere tokens, foretelling the sadde successe and misfortune which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me. I arriued to the place where I was sent, and deliuered my letters to <hi>Don Ferdinandos</hi> brother, &amp; was well intertained, but not wel dispatched; for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to expect (a thing to me most displeasing) eight dayes, and that out of the Duke his fathers presence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his brother had written vnto him to send him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine moneyes vnknowne to his father. And all this was but false <hi>Don Ferdinandos</hi> inuention, for his brother wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not money wherewithall to haue dispatched me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, had not he written the contrary.</p>
               <p>This was so displeasing a commandement &amp; order, as almost it brought me to termes of disobeying it, because it seemed to me a thing most impossible to sustaine my life so many daies in the absence of my <hi>Luscinda.</hi> And spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hauing left her so sorrowfull as I haue recounted; yet notwithstanding I did obey like a good seruant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I knew it would be with the cost of my health. But on the fourth day after I had arriued, there came a man in my search with a letter, which he deliuered vnto me, and by the indorsement I knew it to be <hi>Luscindas;</hi> for the hand was like hers. I opened it not without feare
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:173111:149"/> and assailement of my senses, knowing that it must haue beene some serious occasion, which could moue her to write vnto me, being absent, seeing she did it so rarely, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when I was present. I demaunded of the bearer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I read, who had deliuered it to him, and what time he had spent in the way. He answered me that passing by chaunce at mid-day through a streete of the Citie, a very beautifull Ladie did call him from a certaine window: Her eyes were all beblubbered with teares; and said vnto him very hastily: Brother, if thou beest a Christian, as thou appearest to be one, I pray thee for Gods sake, that thou doe forth with addresse this letter to the place and person that the superscription assigneth, (for they be well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen) and therein thou shalt doe our Lord great seruice. And because thou mayest not want meanes to doe it, take what thou shalt finde wrapped in that Handkerchife: and saying so, she threw out of the window a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chife, wherein were lapped vp a hundred Rials, this ring of golde which I carie here, and that letter which I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto you; and presently without expecting mine answere she departed, but first saw me take vp the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchife and letter; and then I made her signes that I would accomplish herein her command: and after percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the paines I might take in bringing you it so well considered, and seeing by the indorsement, that you were the man to whom it was addrest. For Sir I know you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well; and also obliged to doe it by the teares of that beautiful Ladie, I determined not to trust any other with it, but to come and bring it you my selfe in person: and in sixteene houres since it was giuen vnto me, I haue trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the iourney you know, which is at least eighteene leagues long. Whilest the thankefull new messenger spake thus vnto me, I remained in a manner hanging on his words, and my thighes did tremble in such manner, as I could very hardly sustaine my selfe on foote: yet taking courage, at last I opened the letter, whereof these were the Contents.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:173111:149"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The word that</hi> Don Ferdinando <hi>hath past vnto you to speake to your father, that he might speake to mine, he hath accomplished more to his owne pleasure then to your profite. For Sir you shall vnderstand, that he hath demaunded mee for his wife; and my father borne away by the aduantage of worthes which he supposes to be in</hi> Don Ferdinando <hi>more then in you, hath agreed to his demaund in so good earnest, as the espousals shall bee celebrated within these two daies, and that so secretly and alone, as onely the heauens and some folke of the house shall be witnesses. How I remaine, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and whether it be conuenient you should returne you may consider: and the successe of this affaire shall let you to perceiue, whether I loue you well or no. I beseech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God that this may arriue vnto your hands, before mine shall see it selfe in danger to ioyne it selfe with his, which keepeth his promised faith so ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were in some, the contents of the letter, and the motiues that perswaded me presently to depart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attending any other answere, or other monies: for then I conceiued clearly, that it was not the buyall of the horses, but that of his delights, which had moued <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> to send me to his brother. The rage which I conceiued against him ioyned with the feare to lose the iewell which I had gained by so many yeares seruice, and desires, did set wings on mee, for I arriued as if I had flien the next day at mine owne Citie, in the houre and moment fit to goe speake to <hi>Luscinda.</hi> I entred secretly, and left my Mule whereon I rode in the honest mans house, that had brought mee the letter and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune proposing then to be fauourable to me, disposed so mine affaires that I found <hi>Luscinda</hi> sitting at that yron grate, which was the sole witnesse of our loues. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda</hi> knew me straight and I her, but not as we ought to know one another. But who is hee in the world which may truly vaunt, that he hath penetrated, and throughly exhausted the consused thoughts, and mutable nature of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:173111:150"/> women? truly none. I say then to proceede with my tale, that as soone as <hi>Luscinda</hi> perceiued me she said <hi>Cardenio</hi> I am attired with my wedding garments, and in the Hall doe waite for mee, the traitor <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> and my couetous father with other witnesses, which shall rather be such of my death, then of mine espousals; bee not troubled deare friend, but procure to be present at this sacrifice, the which if I cannot hinder by my perswasions and reasons, I carry hidden about me a poynard secretly which may hinder more resolute forces, by giuing end to my life, and a beginning to thee, to know certaine the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I haue euer borne, and doe beare vnto thee. I answered her troubled and hastily, fearing I should not haue the leasure to reply vnto her, saying sweete La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, let thy works verifie thy words, for if thou carriest a poynard to defend thy credit, I doe heere likewise beare a sword wherewithall, I will defend thee, or kill my selfe if fortune proue aduerse and contrary. I beleaue that she could not heare all my words by reason she was called hastily away as I perceiued, for that the bridegroome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her comming. By this the night of my sorrowes did throughly fall, and the Sunne of my gladnesse was set: and I remained without light in mine eyes, or discourse in my vnderstanding. I could not finde the way into her house, nor could I moue my selfe to any part: yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at last how important my presence was, for that which might befall in that aduenture, I animated my selfe the best I could, and entred into the house; and as one that knew very well all the entries and passages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and specially by reason of the trouble and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse that was then in hand, I went in vnperceiued of any. And thus without being seene, I had the oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to place my selfe in the hollow roome of a window of the same Hall, which was couered by the endes of two incountring peeces of tapestry, from whence I could see all that was done in the Hall, remaining my selfe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:173111:150"/> vnuiewed of any. VVho could now describe the assaults and surprisals of my heart whilst I there abode: The thoughts which incountred my mind, the considerations which I had, which were so many and such, as they can neither be said, nor is it reason they should. Let it suffice you to know, that the bridegroome entred into the Hall without any ornament, wearing the ordinary array hee was wont, and was accompanied by a cousen Germaine of <hi>Luscindas,</hi> and in all the Hall there was no stranger present, nor any other then the household seruants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after <hi>Luscinda</hi> came out of the Parlōur accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her mother and two waiting maides of her owne, as richly attired and deckt, as her calling and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deserued, and the perfection of courtly pompe and brauery could affoord my distraction and trouble of mind lent me no time to note particularly the apparrell shee wore, and therefore did onely marke the colours which were carnation and white; and the splendour which the precious stones and Iewels of her tires, and all the rest of her garments yeelded: yet did the singular beauty of her faire and golden tresses surpasse them so much, as being in competencie with the precious stones, and flame of foure linkes that lighted in the Hall, yet did the splendour thereof seeme farre more bright and glorious to mine eies. O memory the mortall enemie of mine ease, to what end serues it now to represent vnto me the vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable beautie of that my adored enemy. Were it not better cruel memory to remember &amp; represent that which she did then, that being moued by so manifest a wrong, I may at least endeuour to lose my life, since I cannor procure a reuenge? Tire not good sirs to heare the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions I make, for my griefe is not of that kinde that may be rehearsed succinctly and speedily; seeing that in mine opinion euery passage of it is worthy of a large discourse.</p>
               <p>To this the Curate answered, that not onely they were
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:173111:151"/> not tyred or wearied, hearing of him, but rather the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued maruellous delight to heare him recount each minui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and circumstance, because they were such, as deserued not to be past ouer in silence, but rather merited as much attention as the principall parts of the History: you shall then wit (quoth <hi>Cardenio)</hi> that as they thus stood in the Hall, the Curate of the Parish entred, and taking them both by the hand, to doe that which in such an act is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the saying of, <hi>Will you Ladie</hi> Luscinda <hi>take the Lord</hi> Don Ferdinando <hi>who is heere present for your lawfull spouse, according as our holymother the Church commands?</hi> I thrust out all my head and neck out of the tapistry, and with most attentiue eares and a troubled mind, setled my selfe to heare what <hi>Luscinda</hi> answered; expecting by it the sentence of my death, or the confirmation of my life. O if one had dared to sally out at that time, and cried with a loud voice: O <hi>Luscinda, Luscinda,</hi> see well what thou doest, consider withall what thou owest me. Behold how thou art mine, and that thou canst not be any others, note that thy saying of yea, and the end of my life shall be both in one instant. O traytor <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> robber of my glory, death of my life, what is this thou preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest? what wilt thou doe? Consider that thou canst not Christian like atchieue thine intention, seeing <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda</hi> is my spouse, and I am her husband. O foolish man now that I am absent, and farre from the danger, I say what I should haue done, and not what I did. Now after that I haue permitted my deere Iewel to be robbed, I exclaime on the theese, on whom I might haue reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my selfe, had I had as much heart to doe it as I haue to complaine. In fine since I was then a coward and a foole, it is no matter though I now die ashamed, sory, and franticke. The Curate stood expecting <hi>Luscindaes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere a good while erre she gaue it, and in the end, when I hoped that she would take out the Poynard to stab her selfe, or would vnloose her tongue to say some truth, or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:173111:151"/> vse some reason or perswasion that might redound to my benefit, I heard heere in stead thereof answere with a dismaied and languishing voice the word: <hi>I will:</hi> and then <hi>Don Fernando</hi> said the same, and giuing her the ring, they remained tyed with an indissoluble knot. Then the bridegroome comming to kisse his spouse, she set her hand vpon her heart, and fell in a trance betweene her mothers armes.</p>
               <p>Now onely remaines vntold the case wherein I was, seeing in that, yea, which I had heard my hopes deluded, <hi>Luscindaes</hi> words and promises falsified; and my selfe wholy disabled to recouer in any time the good which I lost in that instant, I rested void of counsell, abandoned (in mine opinion) by heauen, proclaimed an enemy to the earth which vpheld me, the ayre denying breath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for my sighes, and the water, humour sufficient to mine eyes: only the fire increased in such maner, as I bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughly with rage and iealousie. All the house was in a tumult for this sodaine amazement of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and as her mother vnclasped her bosome to giue her the ayre, there appeared in it a paper foulded vp, which <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> presently seazed on, and went aside to reade it by the light of a torch, and after he had read it, he sate down in a chayre, laying his hands on his cheeke, with manifest signes of melancholy discontent, without bethinking himselfe of the remedies that were applied to his spouse, to bring her againe to her selfe. I seeing all the folke of the house thus in an vprore, did aduenture my selfe to issue, not waighing much whether I were seene or no; bearing withall a resolution (if I were perceiued) to play such a rash part as all the world should vnderstand the iust indignation of my breast, by the reuenge I would take on false <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and the mutable and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied traytresse: But my destinie which hath reserued me for greater euils, if possibly there may be any greater then mine owne, ordained that instant my wit should
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:173111:152"/> abound, whereof euer since I haue so great want: and therefore without will to take reuenge of my greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies (of whom I might haue taken it with all facilitie, by reason they suspected so little my being there) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take it on my selfe, and execute in my selfe the paine which they deserued; and that perhaps with more rigour then I would haue vsed towards them, if I had slaine them at that time, seeing that the sodaine death finisheth presently the pain, but that which doth lingringly torment, kils alwaies without ending the life. To be short, I went out of the house, and came to the other where I had left my Mule, which I caused to bee sadled, and without bidding mine hoast adieu, I mounted on her, and rode out of the Citie, without daring like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lot</hi> to turne back and behold it: and then seeing my selfe alone in the fields, and that the darkenesse of the night did couer me, and the silence thereof inuite me to complain, without respect or feare to be heard or known, I did let slip my voyce and vntied my tongue with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curses of <hi>Luscinda</hi> and <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> as if thereby I might satisfie the wrong they had done me. I gaue her the title, of cruell, vngratefull, false, and scornefull, but specially of couetous, seeing the riches of mine enemie, had shut vp the eyes of her affection, to depriue me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and render it to him, with whom fortune had dealt more frankly and liberally: and in the midst of this tune of maledictions and scornes, I did excuse her saying: that it was no maruaile that a Mayden kept close in her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents house, made and accustomed alwaies to obey them, should at last condiscend to their will specially, seeing they bestowed vpon her for husband so noble, so rich and proper a Gentleman as to refuse him, would be reputed in her to proceed either from want of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from hauing bestowed her affections elsewhere, which things must of force greatly preiudice her good opinion and renowne. Presently would I turne againe to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:173111:152"/> say, that though she had told them that I was her spouse, they might easily perceiue that in chusing me she had not made so ill an election, that she might not be excused, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that before <hi>Don Fernando</hi> offred himselfe, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues could not happen to desire, if their wishes were guided by reason, so fit a match for their daughter as my selfe: and she might easily haue said, before shee put her selfe in that last and forcible passe, of giuing her hand, that I had already giuen her mine, which I would come out to confesse and confirme all that she could any way faine in this case: and concluded in the end, that little loue, lesse iudgement, much ambition and desire of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse caused her to forget the wordes, wherewithall she had deceiued, intertained, and sustained me in my firme hopes and honest desires.</p>
               <p>Vsing these wordes, and feeling this vnquietnesse in my brest, I trauelled all the rest of the night, and strucke about dawning into one of the entries of these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, through which I trauelled three dayes at random, without following or finding any path or way, vntill I arriued at last to certaine meddowes and fieldes, that lie I know not in which part of these mountaines: and finding there certaine heards, I demaunded of them which way lay the most craggy and inaccessible places of these rocks, and they directed me hither; and presently I trauelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, with purpose here to end my life: and entring in among those desarts, my Mule through wearinesse and hunger fell dead vnder me, or rather as I may better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to disburden himselfe of so vile and vnprofitable a burden as he carried in me. I remained a foote, ouercome by nature, and pierced thorow and thorow by hunger, without hauing any helpe, or knowing who might suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me; and remained after that manner I know not how long prostrate on the ground; and then I arose a gaine without any hunger, and I found neere vnto mee certaine Goatheards, who were those doubtlesly that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:173111:153"/> fedde me in my hunger. For they tolde me in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they found me, and how I spake so many foolish and madde wordes, as gaue certaine argument that I was deuoide of iudgement. And I haue felt in my selfe since that time that I enioy not my wits perfectly, but rather perceiue them to be so weakened and impaired, as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a hundred follies, tearing mine apparrell, crying loudly thorow these desarts, cursing my fates, and idely repeating the beloued name of mine enemie, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any other intent or discourse at that time, then to endeauour to finish my life ere long: and when I turne to my selfe, I am so broken and tyred, as I am scarce able to stirre me. My most ordinary Mansion place is in the hollownes of a Corke tree, sufficiently able to couer this wretched carkasse. The Cowheards and the Goatheards that feede their cattell here in these mountaines, moued by charity, gaue me sustenance, leauing meate for me by the wayes, and on the rockes which they suppose I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and where they thinke I may finde it: and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I doe then want the vse of reason, yet doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall necessity induce me to know my meate, and stirreth my appetite to couet, and my will to take it. They tell me when they meete me in my wits, that I doe other times come out to the high wayes, and take it from them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, euen when they themselues doe offer it vnto mee willingly. After this manner doe I passe my miserable life, vntill heauen shall be pleased to conduct it to the last period, or so change my memorie, as I may no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member on the beauty and treacherie of <hi>Luscinda,</hi> or the iniurie done by <hi>Don Ferdinando;</hi> for if it doe me this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour without depriuing my life, then will I conuert my thoughts to better discourses: if not, there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but to pray God to receiue my soule into his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; for I neyther finde valour nor strength in my selfe to ridde my bodie out of the straites, wherein for my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure I did at first willingly intrude it.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:173111:153"/>
               <p>This is Sirs the bitter relation of my disasters: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudge if it be such as may be celebrated with lesse feeling and compassion then that, which you may by this time haue perceiued in my selfe? And doe not in vaine labour to perswade or counsel me that which reason shal affoord you may bee good for my remedie: for it will worke no other effect in me then a medicine prescribed by a skilfull Physitian, to a Patient that will in no sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. I will haue no health without <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and since she pleaseth to be alienate her selfe, being or seeing she ought to be mine: so doe I also take delight to be of the retinue of mishap, although I might be a retainer to good fortune. She hath ordained that her changing shall establish my perdition. And I will labour by procuring mine owne losse, to please and satisfie her wil: and it shal be an example to ensuing ages, that I alone wanted that, wherewithall all other wretches abounded, to whom the impossibility of receiuing comfort, proued sometimes a cure; but in me it is an occasion of greater feeling and harme, because I am perswaded that my harmes cannot end euen with very death it selfe. Here <hi>Cardenio</hi> finished his large discourse, and vnfortunate and amorous History; and iust about the time that the Curate was bethinking himselfe of some comfortable reasons to answer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him: he was suspended by a voyce which arriued to his hearing, which with pittifull accents said what shall be recounted in the fourth part of this Narration.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:173111:155"/> sayes, that as the Curate beganne to bethinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon some answere that might both confort and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate <hi>Cardenio,</hi> hee was hindered by a voyce which came to his hearing, said very dolefully the words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>
               <p>O God! is it possible that I haue yet found out the place which may serue for a hidden Sepulchre, to the load of this loathsome body that I vnwillingly beare so long? Yes it may be, if the solitarinesse of these rockes doe not illude me, ah vnfortunate that I am! How much more gratefull companions will these cragges and thickets proue to my designes, by affoording me leisure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my mishaps to heauen with plaints; then that if any mortall man liuing, since there is none vpon earth from whom may be expected counsell in doubts, ease in complaints, or in harmes remedie. The Curate and his companions heard and vnderstood all the words cleerely, and for as much as they coniectured (as indeede it was) that those plaints were deliuered very neere vnto them, they did all arise to search out the plaintiffe; and hauing gone some twenty steppes thence, they behelde a young youth behinde a rocke, sitting vnder an Ashe tree, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired like a country Swaine, whom by reason his face was inclined, as hee sate washing of his feete in the cleere streame that glided that way, they could not perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne; and therefore approched towards him with so great silence, as they were not descryed by him who only attended to the washing of his feet, which were so white, as they properly resembled two pieces of cleere crystall, that grew among the other stones of the streame. The whitenesse and beautie of the feete amazed them, being not made as they well coniectured, to treade cloddes, or measure the steppes of lazie Oxen, and holding the Plow, as the youthes apparrell would perswade them; and therefore the Curate, who went before the rest, seeing they were not yet espyed, made signes to the other two
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:173111:155"/> that they should diuert a little out of the way, or hide themselues behinde some broken cliffes that were neere the place, which they did all of them, noting what the youth did with very great attention. Hee wore a little browne Capouch, gyrt very neere to his body with a white Towell; also a paire of Breeches and Gamasheos of the same coloured cloth, and on his head a clay colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Cap. His Gamasheos were lifted vp halfe the legge, which verily seemed to be white <hi>Alablaster.</hi> Finally, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing washed his feete, taking out a linnen Kerchife from vnder his Cappe, he dried them therewithall, and at the taking out of the Kerchife, he held vp his face, and then those which stood gazing on him had leisure to discerne an vnmatchable beautie, so surpassing great, as <hi>Cardenio</hi> rounding the Curate in the eare, said, this bodie since it is not <hi>Luscinda</hi> can be no humane creature, but a diuine. The youth tooke off his Cappe at last, and shaking his head to the one and other part, did disheauell and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer such beautifull haires, as those of <hi>Phaebus</hi> might iustly emulate them: and thereby they knew the supposed Swaine to be a delicate woman, yea and the fairest that euer the first two had seene in their liues, or <hi>Cardenio</hi> himselfe, the louely <hi>Luscinda</hi> excepted; for as he after affirmed, no feature saue <hi>Luscindas</hi> could contend with hers. The long and golden haires did not onely couer her shoulders, but did also hide her round about, in such sort, as (her feete excepted) no other part of her body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they were so neere and long. At this time her hands serued her for a Combe, which as her feete seemed pieces of crystall in the water, so did they appeare among her haires like pieces of driuen Snow. All which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances did possesse the three which stood gazing at her with great admiration, and desire to know what she was; and therefore resolued to shew themselues; and with the noyse which they made when they arose, the beautifull mayden held vp her head, and remouing her haires from
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:173111:156"/> before her eyes with both handes, she espyed those that had made it, and presently arising full of feare and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, she laid hand on a packet that was by her, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be of apparrell, and thought to flie away, without staying to pull on her shooes, or to gather vp her haire: But scarce had she gone sixe paces when her delicate and tender feete, vnable to abide the rough encounter of the stones made her to fall to the earth. Which the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, they came out to her, and the Curate arriuing first of all, said to her: Ladie, whatsoeuer you be, stay and feare nothing; for we which you beholde here, come on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with intention to doe you seruice, and therefore you neede not pretend so impertinent a flight, which neyther your feete can endure nor would we permit. The poore Gyrle remained so amazed and confounded, as shee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered not a word: wherefore the Curate and the rest drawing neerer, he tooke her by the hand, and then hee prosecuted his speech, saying, What your habite concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from vs Ladie, your haires haue bewrayed, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest arguments that the causes were of no smal moment which haue thus bemasked your singular beauty, vnder so vnworthy array; and conducted you to this all-aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned desart; wherein it was a wonderfull chaunce to haue met you, if not to remedie your harmes, yet at least to giue you some comfort, seeing no euill can afflict and vexe one so much, and plunge him in so deepe extreames, (whilest it depriues not the life) that will wholly abhorre from listening to the aduice that is offered, with a good and sincere intention; so that faire Ladie, or Lord, or what else you shall please to be termed, shake off your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment, and rehearse vnto vs your good or ill fortune, for you shall finde in vs ioyntly, or in euery one apart, companions to helpe you to deplore your disasters.</p>
               <p>Whilest the Curate made this speech, the disguised woman stood as one halfe asleepe, now beholding the one, now the other, without once mouing her lippe or
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:173111:156"/> saying a word; much like vnto a rusticke Clowne, when rare and vnseene things to him before, are vnexpectedly presented to his view. But the Curate insisting and vsing other perswasiue reasons addrest to that effect, won her at last to make a breach on her tedious silence, and with a profound sigh blow open her currall gates, saying som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to this effect: Since the solitarinesse of these rockes hath not beene potent to conceale me, nor the disheaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my disordered haires, licensed my tongue to belie my sexe, it were in vaine for me to faine that anew, which if you beleeued it, would be more for courtesies sake then any other respect. Which presupposed, I say good Sirs, that I doe gratifie you highly for the liberall offers you haue made me, which are such, as haue bound me to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your demaund as neere as I may; although I feare the relation which I must make to you of my mishappes, will breede sorrow at once with compassion in you, by reason you shal not be able to find any salue that may cure, comfort, or beguile them: yet notwithstanding to the end my reputation may not houer longer suspended in your opinions, seeing you know me to be a woman, and view me, young, alone and thus attyred, being things all of them able eyther ioyned or parted, to ouerthrow the best credite, I must be enforced to vnfolde, what I could otherwise most willingly conceale. All this she that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so comely spoke without stoppe, or staggering, with so ready deliuerie and so sweete a voice, as her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion admired them no lesse then her beautie. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing againe their complements and intreaties to her, to accōplish speedily her promise, she setting all coynesse apart, drawing on her shooes very modestly, and winding vp her haire, sate her downe on a stone, and the other three about her, where she vsed no little violence to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine rebellious teares that stroue to breake forth without her permission: and then with a reposed and cleere voyce she began the Historie of her life in this manner.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:173111:157"/>
               <p>In this Prouince of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> there is a certaine Towne, from whence a Duke deriues his denomination, which makes him one of those in Spain are call'd <hi>Grandes:</hi> He hath two sonnes, the elder is heire of his States, and likewise as may be presumed of his vertues: the younger is heire I know not of what, if it be not of <note n="*" place="margin">One that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Sancho</hi> King of Castile, as he was easing himselfe at the siege of Camora.</note>
                  <hi>Ʋellido</hi> his treacheries, or <hi>Galalous</hi> fraudes. My parents are this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemans vassals, of humble and low calling; but so rich, as if the goods of nature had equalled those of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, then should they haue had nothing else to desire, nor I feared to see my selfe in the misfortunes, wherein I now am plunged. For perhaps my mishaps proceed from that of theirs in not being nobly descended. True it is that they are not so base, as they should therefore shame their calling, nor so high as may check my conceit, which perswades me, that my disasters proceede from their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. In conclusion, they are but Farmours, and plaine people, but without any touch or spot of badde bloud, and as we vsually say, Olde rustie Christians, yet so rustie and auncient, as it, their riches, and magnificent porte, gaines them by little and little the title of Gentilitie; yea, and of worship also; although the treasure and Nobility, whereof they made most price and account, was to haue had me for their daughter: and therefore as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they had none other heire then my selfe, as also because as affectionate parents, they held me most deere: I was one of the most made of and cherished daughters that euer father brought vp: I was the mirrour wherein they beheld themselues, the staffe of their olde age, and the subiect to which they addrest all their desires. From which, because they were most vertuous, mine did not stray an inch: and euen in the same manner that I was Ladie of their mindes, so was I also of their goods. By me were seruants admitted or dismissed: the notice and account of what was sowed or reaped, past through my handes, of the Oyle-mils, the Wine-presses, the number of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:173111:157"/> great and little cattell, the Bee-hiues; in fine, of all that which so rich a Farmour as my father was, had or could haue; I kept the account, and was the Steward thereof and Mistresse, with such care of my side and pleasure of theirs, as I cannot possible endure it enough. The times of leisure that I had in the day, after I had giuen what was necessary to the head seruants, and others, labourers I did intertaine in those exercises, which were both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and requisite for maydens, to wit, in sowing, making of bone-lace, and many times handling the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffe: and if sometimes I left those exercises to recreate my minde a little, I would then take some godly booke in hand, or play at the Harpe; for experience had caught me, that musicke ordereth disordered mindes, and doth ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the passions that afflict the spirit. This was the life which I ledde in my fathers house: the recounting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so particularly, hath not beene done for ostentation, nor to giue you to vnderstand that I am rich, but to the end you may note how much, without mine owne fault haue I falne from that happy state I haue said, vnto the vnhappie plight into which I am now reduced. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie therefore is this, that passing my life in so many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, and that with such recollection as might bee compared to a religious life, vnseene as I thought by any other person then those of our house: for when I went to Masse it was commonly so earely, and so accompanied by my mother and other maid-seruants; and I my selfe so couerd and watchfull, as mine eyes did scarce see the earth whereon I treade: and yet notwithstanding those of loue, or as I may better terme them, of idlenesse, to which <hi>Linces</hi> eyes may not be compared, did represent me to <hi>Don Ferdinandos</hi> affection and care; for this is the name of the Dukes younger sonne, of whom I spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Scarce had she named <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> when <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> changed colour, and began to sweate with such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of bodie and countenance, as the Curace and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:173111:158"/> Barber which beheld it, feared that the accident of fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie did assault him which was wont as they had heard to possesse him at times. But <hi>Cardenio</hi> did nothing else then sweat, and stood still beholding now and then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey gyrle imagining straight what she was, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice of his alteration, followed on her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in this manner. And scarce had he seene me when (as he himselfe after confest) he abode greatly surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by my loue, as his actions did after giue euident demonstration.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, soone the relation of those misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which haue no conclusion, I will ouerslip in silence the diligences and practises of <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> vsed to declare vnto me his affection: he suborned all the folke of the house. He bestowed gifts and fauours on my parents: euery day was a holy day, and a day of sports in the streets where I dwelled: at night no man could sleepe for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke; the letters were innumerable that came to my hands without knowing who brought them; farsed too full of amorous conceits and offers; and containing more promises and protestations then they had characters. All which, not onely could not mollifie my mind, but rather hardened it as much as if he were my mortal enemie, and therefore did construe all the indeuours he vsed to gaine my good will to be practised to a contrary end: which I did not, as according <hi>Don Fernando</hi> vngentle, or that I esteemed him too importunat, for I took a kind of delight to see my selfe so highly esteemed and beloued of so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Gentleman: nor was I any thing offended to see his papers written in my praise; for if I be not deceiued in this point, be we women euer so foule, we loue to heare men call vs beautifull. But mine honesty was that which opposed it selfe vnto all these things, and the continuall admonitions of my parents, which had by this plainely perceiued <hi>Don Fernandos</hi> pretence as one that cared not, all the world should know it. They would often say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:173111:158"/> me, that they had deposited their honours and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in my vertue alone and discretion, and bad me consider the inequality that was betweene <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and me, and that I might collect by it how his thoughts (did he euer so much affirme the contrary) were more addrest to compasse his pleasures then my profit. And that if I feared any inconuenience might befall, to the end they might crosse it, &amp; cause him to abandon his so vniust a pursuite they would match me where I most liked, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the best of that towne, or any other towne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, saying they might easily compasse it, both by reason of their great wealth and my good report. I forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my resolution and integrity with these certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and the knowne truth which they told me, and therefore would neuer answere to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> any word, that might euer so farre of argue the least hope of condiscending to his desires. All which cautions of mine which I think he deemed to be disdains, did inflame more his lasciuious appetite (for this is the name wherewithal I intitle his affection towards me) which had it beene such as it ought, you had not knowne it now, for then the cause of reuealing it had not befalne me. Finally <hi>Don Fernando</hi> vnderstand how my parents meant to marrie mee: to the end they might illude his hope of euer pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing me, or at least set more gards to preserue mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and this newes or surmise was an occasion that hee did, what you shall presently heare.</p>
               <p>For one night as I sate in my chamber only attended by a young Mayden that serued me, I hauing shut the doores very safe, for feare least through any negligence my hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie might incur any danger without knowing or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how it might happē: notwithstanding all my diligē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vsed and preuentions, &amp; amidst the solitude of this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and recollection, he stood before me in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. At his presence I was so troubled as I lost both sight and speech, and by reason thereof could not crie, nor I
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:173111:159"/> thinke he would not though I had attempted it, permit me. For he presently ranne ouer to me, and taking me betweene his armes (for as I haue said I was so amazed, as I had no power to defend my selfe) he said such things to me as I knew not how it is possible that vntruth should haue the ability to faine things resembling in shew so much the truth: and the traytor caused teares, to giue credit to his words, and sighes to giue countenance to his intention. I poore soule being alone amidst my friends, &amp; weakly practised in such affairs began I know not how to account his leesings for verities, but not in such sort, as his teares or sighes might any wise moue me to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion that were not commendable. And so the first trouble &amp; amazement of mind being past. I began again to recouer my defectiue spirits, and then said to him with more courage then I thought I should haue had, if as I am my Lord betweene your armes, I were betweene the pawes of a fierce <hi>Lyon,</hi> and that I were made certaine of my liberty on condition to doe or say any thing preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to mine honour: it would proue as impossible for me to accept it, as for that which once hath beene, to leaue off his essence and being. Wherefore euen as you haue ingyrt my middle with your armes, so likewise haue I tied fast my minde with vertuous and forcible desires, that are wholy discrepant from yours, as you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, if seeking to force me, you presume to passe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your inordinate designe, I am your vassall, but not your slaue, nor hath the nobility of your bloud power nor ought it to harden, to dishonour, staine or hold in little account the humility of mine; and I doe esteeme my selfe though a countrey wench and farmers daughter, as much as you can your selfe, though a Nobleman and a Lord: With me your violence shall not preuaile, your riches gaine any grace, your words haue power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or your sighes and teares be able to moue: yet if I shall finde any of these properties mentioned in him
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:173111:159"/> when my parents shall please to bestow on me for my spouse, I will presently subiect my will to his, nor shall it euer varie from his minde a iot: So that if I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with honor, although I rested void of delights, yet would I willingly bestow on you, that which you present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour so much to obtaine: all which I do say to diuert your straying thought from euer thinking that any one may obtaine of me ought who is not my lawfull spouse: If the let onely consistes therein most beautifull <hi>Dorotea</hi> (for so I am called) answered the disloyall Lord: behold I giue thee here my hand to be thine alone: and let the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens from which nothing is concealed; and this Image of our Lady which thou hast heere present, be witnesses of this truth. When <hi>Cardenio</hi> heard her say that she was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dorotea,</hi> he fell again into his former suspicion, and in the end confirmed his first opinion to be true: but would not interrupt her speech, being desirous to know the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, which he knew wholy almost before, and therefore said onely. Lady is it possible that you are named <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea.</hi> I haue heard speake of another of that name, which perhaps hath runne the like course of your misfortunes: but I request you to continue your relatiō, for a time may come wherein I may recount vnto you things of the same kinde, which will breed no small admiration. <hi>Dorotea</hi> noted <hi>Cardenios</hi> words, and his vncouth, and disastrous attire, and then intreated him very instantly if he knew any thing of her affaires, he would acquaint her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. For if fortune had left her any good, it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the courage which she had to beare patiently and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that might befall her, being certaine in her opinion that no new one could arriue which might increase a whit those she had alreadie. Ladie I would not let slip the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (quoth <hi>Cardenio)</hi> to tell you what I thinke, if that which I imagine were true: and yet there is no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie left to doe it: nor can it auaile you much to know it. Let it be what it list said <hi>Dorotea:</hi> but that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:173111:160"/> befell, of my relation was this: That <hi>Don Fernando</hi> tooke an Image that was in my chamber for witnesse of our contract, and added withall most forcible words and vnusuall oathes, promising vnto me to become my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Although I warned him, before he had ended his speech, to see well what he did, and to weigh the wrath of his father, when he should see him married to one so base, and his vassall, and that therefore he should take heede that my beautie such as it was should not blinde him. Seeing he should not finde therein a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for his errour: and that if he meant to doe me any good, I coniured him by the loue that he bore vnto me, to license my fortunes to roule in their owne spheare, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as my quality reached: For such vnequall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe neuer please long, nor perseuer with that delight wherewithall they begunne.</p>
               <p>All the reasons heere rehearsed, I said vnto him, and many moe; which now are falne out of minde, but yet proued of no efficacy to weane him from his obstinate purpose, euen like vnto one that goeth to buy; which intention neuer to pay for what he takes: and therefore neuer considers the price, worthinesse, or faultlesse of the stuffe he takes to credit. I at this season made a briefe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and said thus to my selfe: I may doe this, for I am not the first which by matrimonie hath ascended from a low degree to a high estate: nor shall <hi>Don Fernando</hi> be the first whom beautie or blind affection (for that is the most certaine) hath induced to make choyce of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort vnequall to his greatnesse. Then since herein I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate no new world, nor custome, what error can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by embracing the honour wherewithall fortune crownes me: Although it so befell that his affection to to me endured no longer then till he accomplish his will, for before God, I ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes shall still remaine his wife. And if I should disdainfully giue him the repulse, I see him now in such termes, as perhaps forgetting the dutie of a Noble
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:173111:160"/> man, hee may vse violence, and then shall I remaine for euer dishonoured, and also without excuse of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the ignorant which knew not how much without any fault I haue falne into this ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For, what reasons may be sufficiently forcible to perswade my father and other that this Noble man did enter into my chamber without my consent? All these demaunds and answers did I in an instant reuoule in mine imagination, and found my selfe chiefly forced (how I cannot tell) to assent to his petition, by the witnesses hee inuoked, the teares hee shed, and finally by his sweete disposition and comely feature, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with so many arguments of vnfained affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were able to conquere and enthrall any other heart, though it were as free and wary as mine owne. Then called I for my waiting Maide that she might on earth accompany the celestiall witnesses. And then <hi>Don Fernando</hi> turned againe to reiterate and confirme his oathes, and added to his former, other new Saints as witnesses, and wished a thousand succeeding maledictions to light on him, if he did not accomplish his promise to me. His eyes againe waxed moyst, his sighes increased, and himselfe inwreathed mee more straightly betweene his armes, from which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once loosed mee: and with this, and my Maydens departure, I left to be a Mayden, and hee beganne to be a traytor, and disloyall man. The day that succeded to the night of my mishaps came not I thinke so soone as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> desired it: for after a man hath satisfied that which the appetite couets, the greatest delight it can take after is to appart it selfe from the place where the desire was accomplished. I say this, because <hi>Don Fernando</hi> did hasten his departure from me, by my Maids industrie, who was the very same that had brought him into my chamber, hee was got in the streete before dawning. And at his departure from mee he said (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:173111:161"/> not with so great shew of affection and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, as hee had vsed at his comming) that I might be secure of his faith, and that his oathes were firme most true: and for a more confirmation of his word hee tooke a rich ring off his finger, and put it on mine. In fine he departed and I remained behinde I cannot well say, whether ioyfull or sad; but this much I know that I rested confused and pensiue, and almost beside my selfe for the late mischance; yet eyther I had not the heart, or else I forgot to chide my Maide for her treacherie committed by shutting vp <hi>Don Fernando</hi> in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for as yet I could not determine, wherther that which had befalne mee, was a good or an euill. I said to <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> at his departure that he might see mee other nights when he pleased by the same meanes hee had come that night seeing I was his owne, and would rest so, vntill it pleased him to let the world know that I was his wife. But hee neuer returned againe, but the next night following; could I see him after for the space of a moneth eyther in the streete or Church, so as I did but spend time in vaine to expect him: although I vnderstoode that hee was still in towne, and rode euerie other day a hunting an exercise to which hee was much addicted.</p>
               <p>Those dayes were I know, vnfortunate and accursed to me, and those houses sorrowfull; for in them I began to doubt, nay rather wholly to discredite <hi>Don Fernando</hi> his faith: and my maide did then heare loudly the checkes I gaue vnto her for her presumption, euer vntill then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled. And I was moreouer constrained to watch and keepe guard on my teares and countenance, lest I should giue occasion to my parents to demaund of me the cause of my discontents, and therby ingage me to vse ambages or vntruthes to couer them. But all this ended in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, one moment arriuing whereon all these respects stumbled, all honourable discourses ended, patience was
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:173111:161"/> lost, and my most hidden secrets issued in publicke: which was when there was spread a certaine rumour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the towne within a few dayes after, that <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> had married in a Citie neere adioyning, a damzell of surpassing beautie, and of very noble birth, although not so rich, as could deserue by her preferment or dowrie so worthy a husband. It was also said, that she was named <hi>Luscinda,</hi> with many other things that hapned at their Spousals, worthy of admiration. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hearing <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda</hi> named, did nothing else but lift vp his shoulders, bite his lippe, bend his browes, and after a little while shedde from his eyes two floods of teares. But yet for all that <hi>Dorotea</hi> did not interrupt the file of her Historie, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This dolefull newes came to my hearing, and my heart in steede of freezing thereat, was so inflamed with choler and rage, as I had welnigh runne out to the streets, and with outcries published the deceit and treason that was done to me: but my furie was presently asswaged by the resolution which I made, to doe what I put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the very same night, and then I put on this habite which you see, being giuen vnto me by one of those that among vs Countrey-folke are called Swaines, who was my fathers seruant; to whom I disclosed all my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and requested him to accompany me to the Citie, where I vnderstood mine enemie soiourned. He, after he had reprehended my boldnesse, perceiuing me to haue an inflexible resolution, made offer to attend on me as hee said, vnto the end of the world: and presently afeer I trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp in a pillowbeate, a womans attire, some mony and jewels, to preuent necessities that might befall; and in the silence of night, without acquainting my treacherous maide with my purpose, I issued out of my house, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by my seruant, and many imaginations: and in that manner set on towards the Citie, and though I went on foote, was yet borne away flying, by my desires, to come if not time enough to hinder that which was past,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:173111:162"/> yet at least to demaund of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> that he would tell me with what conscience or soule he had done it. I arriued where I wished within two dayes and a halfe; and at the entry of the Citie I demaunded where <hi>Luscin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> her father dwelled? and he of whom I first demaunded the question answered me more then I desired to heare: he shewed me the house, and recounted to me all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell at the daughters marriage, being a thing so publique and knowne in the Citie, as men made meetings of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to discourse thereof. Hee said to me that the very night wherein <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was espoused to <hi>Luscinda,</hi> after that she had giuen her consent to be his wife, shee was instantly assayled by a terrible accident, that strucke her into a traunce, and her spouse approching to vnclaspe her bosome, that she might take the ayre, found a paper foulded in it, written with <hi>Luscindas</hi> owne hand, wherein she said and declared, that she could not be <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> wife, because she was already <hi>Cardenioes,</hi> who was, as the man tolde me, a very principall Gentleman of the same Citie; and that if she had giuen her consent to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> it was onely done because she would not diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey her parents: in conclusion he tolde me, that the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let made also mention, how shee had a resolution to kill her selfe presently after the marriage, and did also lay downe therein the motiues she had to doe it. All which as they say, was confirmed by a poynard that was found hidden about her in her apparrell. Which <hi>Don Fernando</hi> perceiuing presuming that <hi>Luscinda</hi> did flout him, and holde him in little account, hee set vpon her ere she had turned to her selfe, and attempted to kill her with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same poynard; and had done it if her father and other friends which were present had not opposed themselues, and hindered his determination. Moreouer they reported that presently after <hi>Don Fernando</hi> absented himselfe from the Citie, and that <hi>Luscinda</hi> turned not out of her agony vntill the next day, and then recounted to her parents
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:173111:162"/> how she was verily Spouse to that <hi>Cardenio</hi> of whom we spake euen now. I learned besides that <hi>Cardenio</hi> as it is rumourd, was present at the marriage, and that as soone as he saw her married, being a thing he would neuer haue credited, departed out of the Citie in a desperate moode, but first left behinde him a letter, wherein he shewed at large the wrong <hi>Luscinda</hi> had done to him, and that hee himselfe meant to go to some place where people should neuer after heare of him. All this was notorious, and publiquely bruited throughout the Citie, and euery one spoke thereof, but most of all hauing very soone after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that <hi>Luscinda</hi> was missing from her parents house and the Citie; for shee could not be found in ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both: for which her parents were almost beside themselues, not knowing what meanes to vse to finde her.</p>
               <p>These newes reduced my hopes again to their rancks, and I esteemed it better to find <hi>Don Fernando</hi> vnmarried then married, presuming that yet the gates of my remedy were not wholly shut, I giuing my selfe to vnderstand that heauen had peraduenture set that impediment on the second marriage, to make him vnderstand what hee ought to the first; and to remember, how he was a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> and that he was more obliged to his soule then to humane respects. I reuolued all these things in my mind, and comfortlesse did yet comfort my selfe, by faining large yet languishing hopes to sustaine that life which I now do so much abhor. And whilest I staide thus in the Citie, ignorant what I might doe, seeing I found not <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> I heard a cryer goe about publikely, promising great rewards to any one that could finde me out, giuing signes of the very age &amp; apparrell I wore. And I likewise heard it was bruited abroad, that the youth which came with me had carried me away from my fathers house. A thing that touched my soule very neerely, to view my credite so greatly wrackt, seeing that it was not sufficient
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:173111:163"/> to haue lost it by my comming away, without the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him with whom I departed, being a subiect so base and vnworthy of my loftier thoughts. Hauing heard this crie, I departed out of the Citie with my seruant: who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then began to giue tokens that he faultred in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie he had promised to me: and both of vs together entred the very same night into the most hidden parts of this mountaine, fearing lest we might be found. But as it is commonly said, that one euill cals on another, and that the end of one disaster is the beginning of a greater, so proued it with me; for my good seruant, vntill then faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and trustie, rather incited by his owne villany then my beautie, thought to haue taken the benefite of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which these inhabitable places offered; and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited me of loue, with little shame and lesse feare of GOD or respect of my selfe: and now seeing that I answered his impudencies with seuere and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue wordes, leauing the intreaties aside, wherewithall he thought first to haue compast his will, he began to vse his force. But iust heauen which seldome or neuer neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the iust mans assistance, did so fauour my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as with my weake forces, and very little labour, I threw him downe a steepe rocke, and there I left him, I know not whether aliue or dead. And presently I entred in among these mountaines, with more swiftnesse then my feare and wearinesse required; hauing therein no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proiect or designe, then to hide my selfe in them, and shunne my father and others, which by his intreaty and meanes sought for me euery where. Some moneths are past since my first comming here, where I found a Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who carried me to a village seated in the midst of these rockes, wherein he dwelled and intertained me, whom I haue serued as a Sheepheard euer since, procuring as much as lay in me to abide still in the fielde, to couer these haires, which haue now so vnexpectedly betraide me. Yet all my care and industry was not very beneficiall
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:173111:163"/> seeing my Master came at last to the notice that I was no man but a woman, which was an occasion that the like euill thought sprung in him, as before in my seruant. And as fortune giues not alwayes remedie for the difficulties which occurre, I found neyther rocke nor downefall to coole and cure my Masters infirmitie, as I had done for my man: and therefore I accounted it a lesse inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to depart thence and hide my selfe againe among these desarts, then to aduenture the triall of my strength or reason with him. Therefore, as I say, I turned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boske my selfe, and search out some place, where without any encumbrance I might intreat heauen with my sighes and teares, to haue compassion on my mishap; and lend me industry and fauour, eyther to issue fortunately out of it, or else to die amidst these solitudes, not leauing any memory of a wretch, who hath ministred matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not through her owne default, that men may speake and murmure of her, both in her owne and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries.</p>

               <p>The audients of her sad storie, felt great motions both of pitie and admiration for her misfortunes: and although the Curate thought to comfort and counsell her forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yet was he preuented by <hi>Cardenio,</hi> who taking her first by the hand, said at last; Ladie, thou art the beautifull <hi>Dorotea,</hi> daughter vnto rich <hi>Cleonardo.

For we haue already recounted how raggedly <hi>Cardenio</hi> was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; and therefore she said vnto him, and who art thou friend that knowest so well my fathers name; for vntill this houre (if I haue not forgotten my selfe) I did not once name him throughout the whole Discourse of my vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate tale? I am (answered <hi>Cardenio)</hi> the vnluckie Knight whom <hi>Luscinda</hi> (as thou saidst) affirmed to be her husband. I am the disastrous <hi>Cardenio,</hi> whom the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proceeding of him that hath also brought thee to those termes wherein thou art, hath conducted me to the

I am hee <hi>Dorotea</hi> that was present at <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> vnreasonable wedding, and that heard the consent which <hi>Luscinda</hi> gaue him to be his wife. I was hee that had not the courage to stay and see the end of her traunce, or what became of the paper found in her bosome. For my soule had not power or sufferance, to beholde so many disuentures at once, and therefore abandoned the place and my patience together, and onely left a Letter with mine Hoste, whom I intreated to deliuer it into <hi>Luscinda</hi> her owne handes, and then came into these desarts, with resolution to end in them my miserable life, which since that houre I haue hated as my most mortall enemie. But fortune hath not pleased to depriue me of it, thinking it sufficient to haue impaired my wit, perhaps reseruing me for the good successe befalne me now in finding of your selfe: for that being true (as I beleeue it is) which you haue here discoursed, peraduenture it may haue reserued yet better hap for vs both in our disasters then we doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.

                  <hi>Dorotea</hi> rested wonderfully admired hauing knowne and heard <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and ignoring what competent thanks she might returne him in satisfaction of his large offers, she cast her selfe downe at his feete to haue kist them, which <hi>Cardenio</hi> would not permit: and the Licenciat answered for both praysing greatly <hi>Cardenios</hi> discourse: and chiefly intreated, prayed, and counselled them, that they would go with him to his village, where they might fitte hemselues with such things as they wanted, and also take order how to search out <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Dorotea</hi> to her fathers house, or doe else what they deemed most conuenient. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorotea</hi> grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his courtesies, and accepted the fauour hee proffered. The Barber also who had stood all the while silent and suspended, made them a prettie Discourse, with as friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an offer of himselfe, and his seruice as Master Curate; and likewise did briefly relate the occasion of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, with the extrauagant kinde of madnesse which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had, and how they expected now his Squires returne, whom they had sent to search for him. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hauing heard him named, remembred presently as in a dreame the conflict past betweene them both, and recounted it vnto them, but could not in any wise call to minde the occasion thereof.</p>
               <p>By this time they heard one call for them, and knew by the voyce that it was <hi>Sancho Pancas,</hi> who because hee found them not in the place where he had left them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for them as loudly as he might. They went to meete him, and demaunding for <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:173111:165"/> that he found him all naked to his shirt, leane, yellow, almost dead for hunger, and sighing for his Lady <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea:</hi> and although he had tolde him, how she commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to repaire presently to <hi>Toboso,</hi> where she expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him: yet notwithstanding he answered that he was determined neuer to appeare before her beautie, vntill he had done feats that should make him worthy of her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fauour. And then the Squire affirmed if that humor passed on any further, hee feared his Lord would be in danger neuer to become an Emperour as he was bound in honour, no nor a Cardinall, which was the least that could be expected of him. The Licenciat bid him be of good cheere, for they would bring him from thence whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or no; and recounted to <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Dorotea,</hi> what they had bethought for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> remedie, or at least for the carrying of him home to his house. To that <hi>Dorotea</hi> answered, that she would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the distressed Ladie better then the Barber; and chiefly seeing shee had apparrell wherewithall to acte it most naturally. And therefore desired them to leaue to her charge the representing of all that which should bee needfull for the atchieuing of their designe; for she had read many books of Knighthood, and knew well the stile that distressed damzels vsed, when they requested any fauour of Knights aduenturous. And then neede we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, quoth the Curate, but onely to put our purpose presently in execution. For questionlesse good successe turnes on our side, seeing it hath so vnexpectedly begun alreadie to open the gates of your remedy, and hath also facilitated for vs that wherof we had most necessity in this exigent. <hi>Dorotea</hi> tooke forthwith out of her pillowbeare a whole gowne of very rich stuffe, and a short mantle of another greene stuffe, and a collar and many other rich jewels out of a boxe, wherewithall she adorned her selfe in a trice so gorgeously, as shee seemed a very rich and goodly Ladie. Al which and much more she had brought
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:173111:166"/> with her as she said from her house, to preuent what might happen, but neuer had any vse of them vntill then. Her grace, gesture and beautie liked them all extremely, and made them account <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to be a man of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vnderstanding, seeing he contemned such feature. But he which was most of all admired was <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as he thought (and it was so indeed) that he had not in all the dayes of his life before seene so faire a creature: and he requested the Curate very seriously to tell him who that beautifull Ladie was? and what she sought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those through-fares? This faire Lady friend <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> answered the Curate, is (as if a man said nothing she is so great) is heire apparent by direct line of the mighty Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> and comes in the search of your Lord, to demaund a boone of him, which is, that he will destroy and vndoe a great wrong done vnto her by a wicked Giant; and through the great fame which is spread ouer all <hi>Guinea</hi> of your Lords prowesse, this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse is come to finde him out. A happy searcher, and a fortunate finding, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and chiefly if my Master be so happie as to right that iniurie, and redresse that wrong by killing that, O! the mighty lubber of a Giant whom you say: yes, he will kill him, I am very certaine, if he can once but meete him, and if that he be not a spirit; For my Master hath no kinde of power ouer spirits. But I must request one fauour of you among others most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly good Master Licenciat, and tis, that to the end my Lord may not take an humour of becomming a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall (which is the thing I feare most in this world) that you will giue him counsell to marry this Princesse presently, and by that meanes he shall remaine incapable of the dignitie of a Cardinall, and will come very easily by his Empyre, and I to the end of my desires: for I haue thought well of the matter, and haue found that it is in no wise expedient that my Lord should become a Cardinall, for I am wholy vnfit for any Ecclesiasticall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:173111:166"/> seetng I am a married man, and therefore to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my selfe now with seeking of dispensations to inioy Church-liuings, hauing as I haue both wife and children, were neuer to end: so that all my good consists in that my Lord do marry this Princesse instantly whose name yet I know not, &amp; therfore I haue not said it. She is hight quoth the Curate the Princesse <hi>Micomicona,</hi> for her Kingdome being called <hi>Micomicon,</hi> it is euident she must be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so. That is questionlesse quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I haue knowne many to take their denomination and surname from the place of their birth, calling themselues <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alcala, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Vbeda,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Ʋaledolie:</hi> and perhaps in <hi>Guinea</hi> princes and Queenes vse the same custome, and call themselues by the names of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. So I thinke quoth the Curate, and as touching your Masters marriage with her, I will labour therein as much as lies in my power. Wherewithall <hi>Sancho</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as well satisfied; as the Curate admired at his simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and to see how firmely hee had fixed in his fantasie the very rauings of his master, seeing he did beleeue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt that his Lord should become an Emperour. <hi>Dorotea</hi> in this space had gotten vpon the Curates Mule, and the Barber had somewhat better fitted the beard which he made of the Oxes tayle on his face, &amp; did after intreat <hi>Sancho</hi> to guide them to the place where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, and aduertised him withall, that he should in no wise take any notice of the Curate or Barber, or confesse in any sort that he knew them, for therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted all the meanes of bringing <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to the minde to become an Emperour. Yet <hi>Cardinio</hi> would not goe with them, fearing lest thereby <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might call to minde their contention: and the Curate thinketh also that his presence was not expedient, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, letting the others goe before, and these followed a farre off faire and softly on foote, and ere they departed the Curate instructed <hi>Dorotea</hi> a new, what she
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:173111:167"/> should say, who bid him to feare nothing, for she would discharge her part to his satisfaction, and as bookes of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie required and laid downe.</p>
               <p>They trampled about three quarters of a league, as they espied the Knight, and at last they discouered him among a number of intricate rocks, all apparelled but not armed: and as soone as <hi>Dorotea</hi> beheld him, she strucke her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray, her well bearded Barber following her: and as they approached <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Barber leaped lightly down from his Mule, and ranne towards <hi>Dorotea</hi> to take her down betweene his armes, who allighting, went with a very good grace towards <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and keeled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and although hee striued to make her arise, yet shee remaining still on her knees spake to him in this manner: I will not arise from hence thrice valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and approued knight, vntill your bountie and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie shall grant vnto me one boone, which shall much redound vnto your honour and prize of your person, and to the profit of the most disconsolate and wronged Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell that the Sunne hath euer seene. And if it be so that the valour of your inuincible bee correspondent to the bruite of your immortall fame, you are obliged to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour this comfortlesse weight, that comes from lands so remote, to the sound of your famous name, searching you for to remedie his mishaps. I will not answere you a word faire Lady quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> nor heare a iet of your affaire, vntill you arise from the ground. I will not get vp from hence my Lord quoth the afflicted Ladie, if first of your wonted bountie you doe not grant to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. I do giue and grant it said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> so that it be not a thing that may turne to the dammage or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my king, my countrey, or of her that keepes the key of my heart and liberty. It shall not turne to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or hinderance of those you haue said, good Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the dolorous Damsell; and as she was saying this, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> rounded his Ladie in the eare saying: soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:173111:167"/> to him, Sir you may very well grant the request she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for it is a matter of nothing, it is onely to kill a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Giant, and she that demands it is the mighty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Let her be what she will quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I will accomplish what I am bound, and my conscience shal informe me comformable to the state I haue professed: and then turning to the Damsell he said. Let your great beauty arise, for I grant to you any boone which you shall please to aske of me. Why then quoth the Damsell that which I demaund is, that your magnanimous person come presently away with mee, to the place where I shall carry you, &amp; do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise make me a promise, not to vndertake any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture or demaund vntill you reuenge me vpon a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour who hath against all lawes both diuine, and humane vsurped my kingdome. I say that I grant you all that quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore Ladie you may cast away from this day forward all the melancholy that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you, and labour that your languishing and dismaied hopes may recouer again new strength &amp; courage, for by the helpe of God, &amp; that of mine arme you shall see your selfe shortly restored to your kingdome, and enthroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the chayre of your ancient and great estate, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite and maugre the traytours that shall dare gainesay it: and therefore Hands to the worke for they say, that danger alwaies followes delay. The distressed Damsell striued with much ado to kisse his hand, but <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> who was a most accomplished Knight for courtesie, would neuer condescend thereunto, but making her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, he imbraced her with great kindenesse and respect; and commaunded <hi>Sancho</hi> to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and helpe him to arme himselfe. <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke downe the armes forth with, which hung on a tree like trophies, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guirts armed his Lord in a moment, who seeing himselfe armed said, let vs in Gods name depart from hence to assist this great Lady. The barber kneeled all
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:173111:168"/> this while, &amp; could with much adoe dissemble his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or keepe on his beard that threatned still to fall off, with whose fall perhaps they should all haue remained without bringing their good purpose to passe: and seeing that the boone was granted, and noted the diligence wherewirhall <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made himselfe readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and accomplish the same: hee arose and tooke his Ladie by the hand, and both of them together holpe her vpon her Mule: and presently after <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> leaped on <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and the Barber got vp on his beast, <hi>Sancho</hi> onely remayning a foote: where hee a fresh renued the memory of the losse of his gray Asse, with the want procured to him thereby. But all this he bore with very great patience, because he supposed that his Lord was now in the way, and next degree to be an Emperour: for he made an infallible account that he would marry that Princesse, and at least be King of <hi>Micomicon:</hi> but yet it grieued him to thinke how that Kingdome was in the countrey of blacke Moorer, and that therefore the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which should be giuen to him for his vassails should be all blacke: for which difficultie his imagination coyned presently a good remedie: and he discoursed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this manner. Why should I care, though my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects be all blacke Moores, is there any more to be done, then to loade them in a ship, &amp; bring them into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where I may sell them, and receiue the price of them in readie money? And with that money may I buy some title or Office, wherein I may after liue at mine ease all the daies of my life? No! but sleepe, and and haue no wit, nor abilitie to dispose of things, and to sell thirtie or ten thousand vassailes in the space of one would say, giue me those strawes. I will dispatch thom all, they shall flie the little with the great, or as I can best contriue the matter. And be they euer so blacke I will transforme them into white or yellow ones; come neere and see whether I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sucke well my figers ends: And thus hee trauailed so
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:173111:168"/> sollicitous and glad, as he quite forgot his paine of trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a foote. <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate stood in the meane time beholding all that passed from behinde some bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, where they lay lurking and were in doubt what meanes to vse to issue and ioyne in company with them. But the Curate who was an ingenious and prompt plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuised instantly what was to bee done, that they might attaine their desire, thus he tooke out of his case a payre of sheares, and cut off <hi>Cardenioes</hi> beard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall in a trice, and then gaue vnto him to weare a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Capouch which he himselfe had on, and a blacke cloake; and himselfe walked in a dublet and hose. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> thus attired looked so vnlike that he was before, as he would not haue knowne himselfe in a looking glasse. This being finished, and the others gone on before whilst they disguised themselues, they sallied out with facility to the high way before <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> or his company, for the rocks and many other bad passages did not permit those that were a horsebacke to make so speedie an end of their iourney as they: and when they had throughly past the mountaine, they expected at the foot thereof for the Knight and his companie: and when the Knight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the Curate looked on him very earnestly for a great space, with inkling that he beganne to know him, and after he had a good while beheld him, he ranne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with his arms spread abroad saying. In a good howre be it the mirrour of all knighthood found and my noble country man <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the flower and the creame of gentilitie, the shadow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of the afflicted &amp; the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of knights errāt: and saying this he held <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his left thigh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. Who, admiring at that which he heard that man to say and do, did also reuiew him with attention, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally knew him, &amp; all amazed to see him, made much ado to alight, but the Curate would not permit him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said good Master <hi>Licenciat</hi> permit me
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:173111:169"/> to alight, for it is in no sort decent that I be a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and so reuerend a person as you goe on foote: I will neuer consent thereunto, quoth the Curate, your highnes must needs stay on horseback, seeing that theron you are accustomed to atchieue the greatest feats of Chi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ualrie and aduentures, which were euer seene in our age. For it shall suffice me, who am an vnworthy Priest, to get vp behinde some one of these other Gentlemen that ride in your company, if they will not take it in bad part, yea and I will make account that I ride on <hi>Pegasus,</hi> or the <note n="*" place="margin">A strange beast of Affricke that trauels very swiftly.</note>
                  <hi>Zebra</hi> of the famous Moore <hi>Muzaraque,</hi> who lies yet inchanted in the steepe rocke of <hi>Culema,</hi> neere vnto <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala</hi> of <hi>Henares.</hi> Truely I did not thinke vpon it good Master Licenciat, answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> yet I presume that my Lady the Princesse will be well appaide for my sake to commaund her Squire to lend you the vse of his saddle, and to get vp himselfe on the Croper, if so it be that the beast will beare double. Yes that it will, said the Princesse for ought I know, and likewise I am sure it will not be necessary to commaund my Squire to alight, for he is of himselfe so courteous and courtly, as he will in no wise condescend that an Ecclesiasticall man should go a foote when he may helpe him to a horse. That is most certaine, quoth the Barber; and saying so he alighted, and intreated the Curate to take the saddle; to which courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie he did easily condescend. But by euill fortune as the Barber thought to leape vp behind him: the Mule which was in effect a hired one (&amp; that is sufficient to say it was vnhappy) did lift a little her hinder quarters, and bestowed two or three flings on the ayre, which had they hit on Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> his brest or pate, he would haue bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the quest of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> vpon the Diuill: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Barber was so affrighted, as he fell on the ground with so little heed of his beard, as it fell quite off, and lay spread vpon the ground: and perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe without it, he had no other shift, but to couer his
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:173111:169"/> face with both his handes, and complaine that all his cheeke teeth were strucken out. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beholding such a great sheafe of a beard falne away, without jaw or bloud from the face, he said, I vow this is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test miracles that euer I saw in my life; it hath taken and pluckt away his beard, as smoothly as if it were done of purpose. The Curate beholding the danger wherein their inuention was like to incurre if it were detected, went forthwith, and taking vp the beard came to Master <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> that lay still a playing, and with one push bringing his head towards his owne brest, he set it on againe, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring the while ouer him certaine wordes, which he said were a certaine prayer, appropriated to the setting on of falne beardes, as they should soone perceiue: And so hauing set it on handsomly, the Squire remained as wel bearded and whole as euer hee was in his life: whereat <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> rested maruellously admired, and requested the Curate to teach him that prayer when they were at leasure. For he supposed that the verture therof extended it selfe farther then to the fastning on of beardes; since it was manifest that the place whence the beard was torne, must haue remained without flesh, wounded &amp; il-dight; and seeing it cured all, it must of force serue for more then the beard. It is true, replyed Master Curate; and then promised to instruct him with the secret, with the first oportunity that was presented.</p>
               <p>Then they agreed that the Curate should ride first on the Mule, and after him the other two, each one by turnes vntill they arriued to the Inne, which was about some two leagues thence. Three being thus mounted, to wit, <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Princesse and Curate, and the other three on foote, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> the Barber, and <hi>Sancho Pancas. Don-Quixote</hi> said to the damzell, Madame, let me intreat your highnesse to leade me the way that most pleaseth you. And before she could answere, the Licenciat said, Towards what Kingdome would you trauell? Is it by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:173111:170"/> fortune towards that of <hi>Micomicon?</hi> I suppose it should be thitherwards, or else I know but little of Kingdomes. She who knew very well the Curates meaning, and was her selfe no babe, answered, saying; Yes Sir, my way lies towards that Kingdome. If it be so, quoth the Curate, you must passe thorow the village where I dwell, &amp; from thence direct your course towards <hi>Cartagena,</hi> where you may luckily embarke your selues. And if you haue a prosperous winde, and a quiet and calme Sea, you may come within the space of nine yeares to the sight of the lake <hi>Meona,</hi> I meane <hi>Meolidas,</hi> which stands in this side of your Highnesse Kingdome some hundred dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or more. I take you to be deceiued good Sir, quoth shee; for it is not yet fully two yeares since I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence; and truely I neuer almost had any faire weather, and yet notwithstanding I haue arriued, and come to see that which I so much longed for, to wit, the presence of the worthy <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> whose renowne came to my notice as soone as I touched the earth of Spaine with my foote, and moued me to search for him, to commend my selfe to his courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and commit the iustice of my cause to the valour of his inuincible arme. No more, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to heare my selfe praysed. For I am a sworne enemy of all adulation. And although this be not such, yet notwithstanding the like discourses doe offend my chaste eares. What I can say to you faire Princesse is, that whether I haue valour or not; that which I haue or haue not, shalbe imploied in your seruice, euen to the very losse of my life. And so omitting that til his time, let me intreat good Master Licenciate, to tell me the occasion which hath brought him heere to these quarters so alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attendants, and so slightly attired, as it strikes me in no little admiration? To this I will answere with breuity, quoth the Curate: You shall vnderstand that Master <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the Barber, our very good friend, and my selfe, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:173111:170"/> towards <hi>Siuill,</hi> to recouer certaine summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which a kinseman of mine, who dwels this many yeares in the <hi>Indias</hi> hath sent vnto me. The summe is not a little one, for it surmounted seuenty thousand Rials of eight, all of good waight: see if it was not a rich gift. And passing yesterday through this way we were set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by foure robbers, which dispoyled vs of all, euen to our very beardes, and that in such sort, as the Barber was forced to fet on a counterfeit one: and this young man that goeth here with vs (meaning <hi>Cardenio)</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them anew. And the best of it is, that it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely bruited about all this Commarke, that those which surprised vs were Galley-flaues, who were set at liberty, as it is reproted, much about this same place, by so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a Knight, as in despite of the Commissarie and the guard he freed them all. And questionlesse hee either was wood, or else as great a knaue as themselues, or some one that wanted both soule and conscience, seeing he let slip the Wolues amidst the Sheepe, the Foxe among the Hennes, and Flies hard by Honie; and did frustrate iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, rebell against his naturall Lord and King, for he did so by oppugning his iust commaundements, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued the Gallies of their feete, and set all the <hi>Holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi> in an vprore, which hath reposed these many yeares past. And finally, would doe an acte, by which he should loose his soule, and yet not gaine his bodie. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> had rehearsed to the Curate &amp; Barber the aduenture of the slaues, which his Lord had accomplished with such glorie, and therefore the Curate did vse this vehemencie as he repeated it, to see what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would say or doe, whose colour changed at euery word, and durst not confesse that he was himselfe, and the deliuerer of that good people: and these, quoth the Curate, were they that haue robbed vs, and God of his infinite mercy pardon him who hindered their going to receiue the punishment they had so well deserued.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Carce had the Curate finished his speech throughly, when <hi>Sancho</hi> said: By my faith Master Licenciate, he that did that feate was my Lord, and that not for want of warning, for I told him before hand, and aduised him, that he should see well what he did, and that it was a sinne to deliuer them, because they were all sent to the Gallies for very great villanies they had played. You bottlehead, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> hearing him speake, it concerneth not Knights errant to examine whether the afflicted, inchained, and oppressed which they encounter by the way, be carried in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, or are plunged in that distresse, through their owne default or disgrace; but onely are obliged to assist them as needie and oppressed, setting their eyes vpon their paines and not on their crimes. I met with a Rosarie or beades of inserted people, sorrowful and vnfortunate, and I did for them that which my religion exacts, as for the rest, let them verifie it elsewhere: and to whosoeuer else the holy dignity and honourable person of Master Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat excepted, it shall seeme euill: I say hee knowes but slightly what belongs to Chiualrie; and hee lies like a whoreson and a villaine borne: and this will I make him know with the broade side of my sword. These wordes he said, setling himselfe in his stirrups, and addressing his Morion for the Barbers bason, which he accounted to be <hi>Mambrino</hi> his helmet, he carried hanging at the pomell of his saddle, vntill he might haue it repaired of the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings the Galley slaue had wrought in it. <hi>Dorotea</hi> who
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:173111:171"/> was very disceeete and pleasant, and that was by this well acquainted with <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> faultie humour, and saw all the rest make a rest of him, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> excepted, would also shew her conceit to bee as good as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore said vnto him, Sir knight remember your selfe of the boone you haue promised vnto mee, wherunto conforming your selfe you cannot intermeddle in any other aduenture, be it euer so vrgent. Therfore as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage your stomacke, for if Master Licentiat had known that the gallislaues were deliuered by your inuincible arme he would rather haue giuen vnto himselfe three blowes on the mouth, and also bit his tongue thrice then haue spoken any word whence might result your indignation. That I dare sweare quoth the Curate, yea and besides torne away one of my Mustachioes. Madame said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I will hold my peace, and suppresse the iust cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler already inkindled in my breast, and will ride quietly and peaceably, vntil I haue accomplished the thing I haue promised: and I request you in recompence of this my good desire, if it be not displeasing to you, to tell mee your grieuāce, and how many, which, &amp; what the persons be, of whom I must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I will promptly performe your will herein an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Dorotea,</hi> if it will not bee irkesome to you to listen to disasters, in no sort good Madame said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to which <hi>Dorotea</hi> answered thus, be then atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to my relation. Scarce had she said so when <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> and the Barber came by her side, desirous to heare how the discreete <hi>Dorotea</hi> would faine her tale: and the same did <hi>Sancho,</hi> which was as much deceiued in her person as his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and she after dressing her selfe well in the saddle, bethought and prouided her selfe whilst she coughed and vsed other gestures, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speake in this manner.</p>
               <p>First of all good Sirs I would haue you note that I am called, and heere she stood suspended a while by reason
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:173111:172"/> she had forgotten the name that the Curate had giuen vnto her; but he presently occurd to her succour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the cause and said. It is no wonder great Ladie, that you be troubled and stagger whilest you recount your misfortunes, seeing it is their ordinary custome of disasters to depriue those whom they torment and distract their memory in such sort, as they cannot remember themselues, euen of their owne very names; as now it proues done in your highnesse which forgets it selfe, that you are called the Princes <hi>Micomicona</hi> lawfull inheritix of the great Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon:</hi> and with this note you may easily reduce into your dolefull memorie, all that which you shall please to rehearse. It is very true (quoth the Damsell) and from henceforth I thinke it will not be needfull to prompt me any more, for I will arriue into a safe port, with the narration of my authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Historie: which is, that my father who was called the wise <hi>Imacrio,</hi> was very expert in that which is called Art Magick, and he knew by his science that my mother, who was called Queene <hi>Xaramilla</hi> should die before he deceased, &amp; that he should also passe from this life within a while after, &amp; leaue me an Orphane, but he was woont to say how that did not afflict his mind so much, as that he was very certaine that a huge Giant, Lord of a great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land neere vnto my Kingdome called <hi>Pandafilando, of the duskie sight:</hi> because although his eyes stand in their right places, yet doe they still looke a squint. which he doth to terrifie the beholders. I say that my father knew that this Giant when he should beare of his death, would passe with a maine power into my land, and depriue me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not leauing me the lest village, wherein I might hide my head. Yet might all this be excused, if I would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with him, but as he found out by his science, he knew I would neuer condiscend thereunto, or incline mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to so vnequall a marriage: and herein he said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth, for it neuer past once my thought to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:173111:172"/> that Giant, nor with any other, were he euer so vnreasonable, great and mightie: my father likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then that after his death, and that I should see <hi>Landafilando</hi> vsurpe my kingdome, I should in no wise stand to my defence, for that would proue my destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionction; but leauing to him the kingdome freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubles, if I meant to excuse mine owne death, and the totall ruine of my good and loyall subiects, for it would be impossible to defend my selfe from the diuellish force of the giant; I should presently direct my course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spayne,</hi> where I should find a redresse of my harms, by incountring with a knight errant, whose fame should extend it selfe much about that time throughout that kingdome, and his name should be if I forget not my selfe. <hi>Don Acote</hi> or <hi>Don Gigote.</hi> Ladie you would say <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> or as he is called by another name, <hi>the Knight of the ilfauored face,</hi> you haue reason replied <hi>Dorotea:</hi> he said moreouer, that he should be high of stature, haue a withered face, and that on the right side a little vnder the left shoulder, or thereabouts he should haue a tawny spot with certaine haires like to bristles. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> hearing this said to his Squire, hold my horse heere sonne <hi>Sancho;</hi> and helpe me to take of mine apparrell, for I will see whether I be the Knight off whom the wise king hath prophesied: Why would you now put off your cloathes quoth <hi>Dorotea?</hi> to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I haue that spot which your father mentioned, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> you need not vndoe your apparrell for that purpose said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I know alreadie that you haue a spot with the tokens she named on the very rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of your backe, and argues you to bee a very strong man: that is sufficient quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> for wee must not looke too neere, or be ouer curious in our friends affaires, and whether it be on the shoulder, or ridge of the backe it imports but little, for the substance consists onely in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such a marke, and that wheresoeuer it shall be;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:173111:173"/> seeing all is one, and the selfe same flesh: and doutlesly my good father did ayme well at all, and I like wise in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending my selfe to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for surely he is the man of whom my father spoke, seeing the signes of his face agree with those of the great renowne that is spread abrode of this knight, not onely in <hi>Spayne,</hi> but also in <hi>Ethiopia:</hi> for I had no sooner landed in <hi>Osuna,</hi> when I heard so many of his prowesses recounted, as my minde gaue me presently that he was the man in whose search I trauailed. But how did you land in <hi>Osuna</hi> good Madam quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> seeing it is no Sea-towne? Marrie sir quoth the Curate anticipating <hi>Doroteas</hi> answere, the Princesse would say that after she had landed in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala,</hi> the first place wherein she heard tidings of you was at <hi>Osuna.</hi> So I would haue said quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> and it may be very wel quoth the Curate, and I desire your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to continue your discourse; there needs no farther continuation quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> but that finally my fortune hath beene so fauourable in finding of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> as I doe alreadie hold and account my selfe for Queene and Ladie of all mine estate, seeing that hee of his wonted bountie and magnificence hath promised mee the boone to accompany me wheresoeuer I shall guide him, which shall be to none other place then to set him before <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafilando of the duskie</hi> sight, to the end you may sley him, and restore me to that which he hath so wrongfully vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: for all will succeede in the twinkling of an eye, as the wise <hi>Tinacrio</hi> my good father hath alreadie foretold: who said moreouer, and also left it written in <hi>Chaldai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> or Greeke characters, for I cannot read them, that if the knight of the Prophecie, after hauing beheaded the Giant, would take me to wife, that I should in no sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him, but instantly admitting him for my spouse, make him at once possessor of my selfe and my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>VVhat thinkest thou of this friend <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:173111:173"/>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> then, when he heard her say so, how likest this point? did not I tell thee thus much before? see now whether we haue not a kingdome to commaund, and a Queene whom we may marry? I sweare as much quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> a poxe on the knaue that will not marry as soone as Master <hi>Pandahlado</hi> his windepipes are cut. Mount then and see whether the Queene be ill or no, I would to God all the fleas of my bed turned to be such. And saying so he gaue two or three friskles in the ayre, with very great signes of contentment, and presently went to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotea,</hi> and taking her Mule by the bridle he withheld it, and laying himselfe downe downe on his knees before he requested her very submissiuely to giue him her hands to kisse them, in signe that hee receiued her for his Queene and Ladie. Which of the beholders could abstaine from laughter, perceiuing the masters mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the seruants simplicity? To be briefe <hi>Dorotea</hi> must haue giuen them vnto him, and promised to make him a great Lord in her kingdome, when heauen became so propitious to her, as to let her once recouer and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it peaceablie. And <hi>Sancho</hi> returned her thanks with such words as made them all laugh a new. This is my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie noble Sirs quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> whereof onely restes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that none of all the traine which I brought out of my Kingdome to attend on mee is now extant, but this well bearded squire; for all of them were drowned in a great storme that ouertooke vs in the very sight of the harborough whence he and I escaped, and came to land by the helpe of two plankes, on which we laid hold, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most by miracle, as also the whole discourse and mysterie of my life seemes none other then a miracle, as you might haue noted: And if in any part of the relation I haue exceeded, or not obserued a due <hi>decorum,</hi> you must impute it to that which Master <hi>Licenciat</hi> said to the first of my History, that continuall paines that afflictions of mind depriues them that suffer the like of their memory.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:173111:174"/> That shall not hinder mee (O high and valorous Ladie) quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> from enduring as many as I shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in your seruice be they euer so great or difficult. And therfore I doe anew ratifie &amp; confirme the promise I haue made, and doe sweare to goe with you to the end of the world vntill I finde out your fierce enemy, whose proud head I meane to slice off by the helpe of God, and my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous arme, with the edge of this (I will not say a good) sword: thanks be to <hi>Gines</hi> of <hi>Passamonte,</hi> which tooke away mine owne: this he said murmuring to himselfe, and then prosecuted saying: and after I haue cut it off, and left you peaceably in the possession of your state, it shal rest in your owne will to dispose of your person as you like best. For as long as I shall haue my memory possessed, and my will captiued, and my vnderstanding yeelded to her, I will say no more, it is not possible that euer I moy induce my selfe to marry any other, although shee were a <hi>Phoenix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had said last of all of not marrying disliked <hi>Sancho</hi> so much as lifting his voyce with great anger he said, I vow and sweare by my selfe that you are not in your right wits, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> for how is it possible that you can call the matter of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting so high a Princesse as this is in doubt? do you think that fortune will offer you at euery corners end the like happe of this which is now proffered? Is my Ladie <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea</hi> perhaps more beautifull, no certainly nor the halfe, so faire, nay I am rather about to say, that she comes not to her shoo that is heere present. In an ill howre shel I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to possesse that vnfortunate Earldome which I expect if you go thus seeking for Mushrubs in the bottome of the Sea: Marry, marry your selfe presently; the diuell take you for me, and take that kingdome comes into your hands, and being a King make me presently a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse, or Admirall, and instantly after let the diuell take all if he pleseth. <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who heard such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:173111:174"/> spoken against his Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> could not beare them any longer, and therefore lifting vp his Iaueline without speaking any word to <hi>Sancho,</hi> gaue him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall two such blowes as hee ouerthrew him to the earth: and had not <hi>Dorotea</hi> cried to him, to hold his hand he had doubtlesly slaine him in the place. Thinkest thou (quoth he after a while) base peasant, that I shall haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies leasure and disposition to thrust my hand into my pouch, and that there be nothing else but thou still erring and I pardoning, and dost not thou thinke of it (excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated rascall) for certainly thou art excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, seeing thou hast talked so broadly of the peerelesse <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> and doest not thou know base slaue, vagabond, that if it were not for the valour she infuseth into mine arme, that I should not haue sufficient forces to kill a flea. Say scoffer with the vipers tongue, who dost thou thinke hath gained this kingdome, and cut the head of this Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: and made thee a Marquesse, (For I giue all this for done alreadie, and for a matter ended and iudged) but the worthes and valour of <hi>Dulcinea:</hi> vsing mine arme as the instrument of her act. She fights vnder my person, and ouercomes in me: And I liue and breath in her, and from her I hold my life and being. O whoreson villaine, how vngratefull art thou that seest thy sele exalted out from the dust of the earth to be a Noble man, and yet dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay so great a benefit, with detracting the person that bestowed it on thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> was not so sore hurt, but that he could heare all his Masters reasons very well: wherefore arising some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hastily, he ran behinde <hi>Dorotea</hi> her Palfrey, and from thence said to his Lord: Tell me Sir, if you be not determined to marrie with this Princesse, it is most cleere that the kingdome shall not be yours: and if it be not, what fauours can you be able to doe to me? It is of this that I complaine me, marrie your selfe one for one with this Princesse, now that we haue heere, as it were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:173111:175"/> to vs downe from heauen, and you may after turne to my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> for I thinke there bee Kings in the world, that keepe Lemmans. As for beautie, I will not intermeddle, for if I must say the truth, each of both is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faire, although I haue neuer seene the Ladie <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> How, hast not thou seene her blasphemous traytor, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou didst but euen now bring mee a message from her? I say, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I haue not seene her so leisurely, as I might particularly note her beautie and good parts one by one, but yet in a clap as I saw them, they liked me very well. I doe excuse thee now, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and pardon me the displeasure which I haue giuen vnto thee, for the first motions are not in our hands. I see that well, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why talke is in me of one of those first motions. And I cannot omit to speake once at least, that which comes to my tongue. For all that <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> see well what thou speakest, for the earthen pitcher goes so oft to the water. I will say no more.</p>
               <p>Well then answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> God is in heauen, who seeth all these guiles, and shall be one day iudge of him that sinnes most, of me in not speaking well, or of you by not doing well. Let there be no more, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> but run <hi>Sancho</hi> and kisse your Lords hand, and aske him forgiuenesse, and from henceforth take more heede how you praise or dispraise any body, and speake no ill of that Ladie <hi>Toboso,</hi> whom I doe not know otherwise then to doe her seruice: and haue confidence in God, for thou shalt not want a Lordship wherein thou mayest liue like a King. <hi>Sancho</hi> went with his head hanging downward, and demaunded his Lords hand, which he gaue vnto him with a graue countenance; &amp; after he had kissed it, he gaue him his blessing, and said vnto him, that he had somewhat to say vnto him, and therefore bade hime to come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what forward that he might speake vnto him. <hi>Sancho</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and both of them going a little aside, <hi>Don-Qaixote</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:173111:175"/> said vnto him, I haue not had leisure, after thy comming, to demaund of thee in particular concerning the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that thou carriedst, and the answere that thou broughtest backe: and therefore fortune lends vs now some oportunitie and leisure, doe not denie me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse which thou mayest giue me by thy good newes. Demaund what you please, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere you, and I request you good my Lord, that you be not from henceforth so vengatiue. Why doest thou say so <hi>Sancho?</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixotee.</hi> I say it, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> because that these blowes which you bestowed now, were rather giuen in reuenge of the dissension which the Diuell stirred betweene vs two the other night, then for any thing I said against my Lady <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> whom I doe honour and reuerence as a relike, although she be none, only because she is yours. I pray thee good <hi>Sancho</hi> said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> fal not againe into those discourses, for they offend me. I did pardon thee then, and thou knowest that a new offence must haue a new panence.</p>
               <p>As they talked thus, they espied a gallant comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, riding on an Asse, and when he drew neere he seemed to be an <hi>Aegyptian:</hi> but <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who whensoeuer he met any Asses, followed them with his eyes and his heart, as one that thought still on his owne, had scarce eyed him when he knew that it was <hi>Gines</hi> of <hi>Passamonte,</hi> and by the looke of that Aegyptian, found out the fleece of the Asse: as in truth it was, for <hi>Gines</hi> came riding on his gray Asse: who to the end that hee might not be knowne, and also haue commoditie to sell his beast, attired himselfe like an Aegyptian, whose lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and many others he could speake as well as if they were his mother tongue. <hi>Sancho</hi> saw him and knew him, and scarce had he seene and taken notice of him, when he cried out aloud, Ah thiefe <hi>Ginesillo,</hi> leaue my goods behinde thee, set my life loose, and doe not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with my ease. Leaue mine Asse, leaue my comfort,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:173111:176"/> flie villaine, absent thy selefe thiefe, and abandon that which is none of thine. Hee needed not to haue vsed so many words and frumpes, for <hi>Gines</hi> leaped downe at the verie first, and beginning a trot that seemed rather to be a gallop, he absented himselfe and fled farre enough from them in a moment. <hi>Sancho</hi> went then to his Asse, and imbracing him, said, How hast thou done hitherto my darling and treasure, gray Asse of mine eyes, and my dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest companion: and with that stroked and kissed him as if it were a reasonable creature. The Asse held his peace, and permitted <hi>Sancho</hi> to kisse and cherish him, without answering a word. All the rest arriued, and congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Sancho</hi> for the finding of his Asse, but chiefely <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who said vnto him, that notwithstanding that he found his Asse, yet would not he therefore annull his warrant for the three Colts; for which <hi>Sancho</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him very great thanks.</p>
               <p>Whilest they two trauelled together discoursing thus, the Curate said to <hi>Dorotea,</hi> that she had very discreetely discharged her selfe, as well in the History, as in her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and imitation thereof, to the phrase and conceits of bookes of knighthood: she answered that she did oft times read bookes of that subiect, but that she knew not where the Prouinces lay, nor Sea Ports, and therefore did only say at randome, that she had landed in <hi>Osuna.</hi> I knew it was so, quoth the Curate, and therefore I said what you heard, wherewithall the matter was souldered. But is it not a maruellous thing to see with what facilitie the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Gentleman beleeues all these inuentions and lies, onely because they beare the stile and manner of the follies laid downe in his bookes? It is quoth <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and that so rare and beyond all conceit, as I beleeue if the like were to be inuented, scarce could the sharpest wits deuise such another. There is yet, quoth the Curate, as maruellous a matter as that: for leauing apart the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities which the good Gentleman speakes concerning
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:173111:176"/> his frensie, if you will commune with him of any other subiect whatsoeuer he will discourse on it with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent methode, and shew himselfe to haue a cleere and pleasing vnderstanding. So that, if he be not touched by matters of Chiualry, there is no man but will deeme him to be of a sound and excellent iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> on the other side prosecuted his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing with his Squire, whilest the others talked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and said to <hi>Sancho:</hi> Let vs two friend <hi>Panca</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get olde iniuries, and say vnto me now without any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour or anger, where, how, and when didst thou finde my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea?</hi> What did she when thou camest? What saidst thou to her? What answered shee? What counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance shewed she as she read my Letter? And who writ it out fairely for thee? And euery other thing that thou shalt thinke worthy of notice in this affaire, to be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or answered, without either addition or lying, or soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing adulation: and on the other side do not abbreuiate it, lest thou shouldest defraude me thereby of expected delight. Sir, answered <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I must say the truth, none copied out the Letter for me, for I caried no Letter at all. Thou sayest true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I found the Tablets wherein it was written with my selfe, two dayes after thy departure, which did grieue me exceedingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I knew not what thou wouldest do, when thou didst perceiue the want of the Letter, and I alwaies made full account that thou wouldest returne againe from the place where thou shouldest first misse it. I had done so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if I had not borne it away in memory, when you read it to me, in such sort, as I said it to a Clerke of a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, who did copie it out of my vnderstanding so point by point, as hee said that hee neuer in all the dayes of his life, although he had read many a Letter of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, read or seene so fine a Letter as it was. And dost thou holde it yet in memory <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote?</hi> No Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> for after I gaue it, seeing it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                  <p>Of the pleasant discourses continued betweene <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and his Squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduentures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll this liketh me well, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> therefore say on, thou arriuedst, and what was that Queene of beauty doing then? I dare say that thou foundest her three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Pearls, or imbroidering some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deuice, with Venice golde for me her captiue Knight? No that I did not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but winnowing two bushels of Wheate in the yard of her house. Why then said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou mayest make account that each corne of that Wheate was a graine of Pearle, seeing they were touched by her delicate hand. And friend didst thou note well what the Wheate was, whether of the best or ordinarie? It was not but redde, said <hi>Sancho.</hi> Well then I assure thee, answered <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote,</hi> that being sifted by her hands, it must needes make very faire bread and white. But passe forward, when thou didst deliuer my Letter, did she kisse it? Did she set it on her head? Did she vse any ceremony worthy of such a Letter? Or what did she? When I went to giue it vnto her, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> she was holding vp of her armes with a good quantity of Wheate that she had in her Siue, and therfore said vnto me, friend, lay downe that Letter there
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:173111:177"/> on the sacke, for I cannot reade it vntill I haue winnowed all that is here. O discreete Ladie, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> she surely did that because she might reade it at leasure, and recreate her selfe therewithall. Forward <hi>Sancho,</hi> and as long as she was thus busied, what discourses passed she with thee? What did she demaund of thee concerning me? And thou, what didst thou answere? Say all good <hi>Sancho,</hi> say all, recount to me euery particularity, and let not the least immunity remaine in the Inke-horne. She demaunded nothing of me, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but I recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her the state I had left you in for her sake, doing of penance, all naked from the gyrdle vpward among these rockes like a bruit beast; sleeping on the ground, and eating your bread without Table-clothes, and that you neuer combed your beard, but was weeping and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your fortune. There thou saidst ill (quoth <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote)</hi> for I doe not curse my fortune, but rather blisse it, and will blisse it as long as I shall liue, seeing it hath made me worthy to merite the loue of so high a Lady as <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> of <hi>Toboso:</hi> She is in good faith so high, answered <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> as she surpasseth me almost by a whole cubite. Why how now <hi>Sancho,</hi> said the Knight, hast thou measured thy selfe with her? I did measure my selfe with her in this manner, replyed <hi>Sancho,</hi> that comming ouer to helpe her to lift vp a sack of Wheat on an Asse, we ioyned so neere, as I well perceiued that she was more then a great span higher then my selfe. That is true, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but thinkest thou not that the talnesse of her extended stature is adorned with a thousand millions of graces and indowments of the soule? But <hi>Sancho,</hi> thou canst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie me one thing, when thou didst thus approch her, didst thou not feele a most odoriferous smell, an aromaticall flagrancie, an, I cannot tell what, so pleasing, as I know not how to terme it? I say such a sent, as if thou werst in some curious perfumers shop? That which I know, quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> is, that I felt a little vnsauorie sent, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:173111:178"/> ramish and manlike, and I thinke the reason was, because she had sweat a litle doing of that exercise. It was not so (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> but eyther thou hadst the murre, or else didst smell thy selfe; for I know very well how that Rose among thornes doth sent, that Lillie of the field, and that chosen Amber. It may well be said <hi>Sancho</hi> as you haue said; for I haue had many times such a smell, as me thought the Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> had then: and though she smeld to it were no maruell: for one Diuell is like another. And well (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> see heere, she hath sifted her corne, and sent it to the Mill. What did she after she had read the Letter? The Letter said <hi>Sancho,</hi> she read it not, for she said she could neither reade nor write, and therefore shee tore it into small pieces, and would haue no man to reade it, lest those of the village should know her secrets, and say that what I had tolde her by word of mouth of your loue and extraordinarie penance, which you remayned doing for her sake was sufficient. And finally she concluded, commaunding me to say vnto you, that she had her commended vnto you, and that she remained with greater desire to see you then to write vnto you; and therefore she requested and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, as you tendred her affection, that presently vpon sight hereof you should abandon these shrubbie groues; leaue off your frensie, and take presently the way of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boso.</hi> If some matter of greater importance did not occur, for she had very great desire to see and talke with you. She laughed heartily when I tolde her that you named your selfe <hi>the Knight of the ill-fauoured face.</hi> I demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of her whether the beaten <hi>Biscaine</hi> came there? and she answered that he did, and affirmed withall that hee was a very honest man. I asked also for the Galley-slaues, but she tolde me, that she had seene none of them as yet.</p>
               <p>All goes well till this, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but tell me I pray thee what Iewell did she bestow on thee at thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:173111:178"/> for reward of the newes thou carriedst vnto her of me? For it is an vsuall and ancient custome among Knights and Ladies errant to bestow on Squires, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, or dwarfes which bring thē any good tidings of their Ladies, or seruants, some rich Iewel as a reward &amp; thanks of their welcome newes. It may well be quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and I hold it for a very laudable custome, but I thinke it was onely vsed in times past; for I thinke the manner of this our age is onely to giue a peece of bread, and cheese, for this was all that my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> bestowed on me, and that ouer the yard wals, when I tooke my leaue with her. And in signe thereof (well fare all good tokens) the cheese was made of sheepes milke. She is maruellous liberall quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and if she gaue thee not a Iewell of gold, it was without doubt, because she had none then about her. <hi>But sleeues are good, although they come after the feast.</hi> I will see her and then all things shall be amended, knowest thou <hi>Sancho</hi> whereat I wonder, It is at this sodaine returne, for it seemes to me thou wast gone, and hast come backe againe in the ayre, for thou hast beene away but a little more then three daies, <hi>Toboso</hi> being well nigh thirtie leagues from hence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do beleeue that the wise inchanter, who takes care of mine affaires, and is my friend (for there is such a one of force, and then must bee, vnder paine that I else should not be a good knight errant) I say I verely thinke that wise man holpe thee to trample vnawares of thy selfe: for there are wise men of that condition which will take a Knight errant sleeping in his bed; and without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how or in what manner hee will wake the next day a thousand leagues from that place where he fell a sleepe. And were it not for this, knights errant could not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour one another in their most dangerous exigents, as they do now at euerie step. For it oft-times befalles that a knight is fighting in the mountaines of <hi>Armenia</hi> with some diuellish <hi>Fauno,</hi> some dreadfull shadow, or fierce
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:173111:179"/> knight, where he is like to haue the worst, and in this point of death when I least expect it, there appeares there on the top of a cloude, or riding in a chariot of fire an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight his friend, who was but euen then in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and helpes him, and deliuers him from death, and returnes againe that night to his owne lodging, where hee suppes with a very good appetite, and yet for all that is there woont to bee, two or three thousand leagues from the one to the other countrey. All which is compassed by the industrie and wisedome of those skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inchaunters, that take care of the said valorous knights. So that friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> I am not hard of beleefe in giuing thee credite that thou hast gone and returned in so short a time from this place to <hi>Toboso,</hi> seeing as I haue said, some wise man my friend hath belike transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee thither by stealth, and vnaware, of thy selfe. I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily thinke it replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> for <hi>Rozinante</hi> trauailed in good faith as lustily as if he were an <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Asse with quicksiluer in his eares, and thinkest thou not quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that he had not quicksiluer in his eares? yes and a legion of diuels also to helpe it, who are folke that doe trauaile and make others goe as much as they list without any wearinesse.</p>
               <p>But leauing all this apart, what is thine opinion that I should doe now, concerning my Ladies commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to goe and see her: for although I know that I am bound to obey her behests: yet doe I finde my selfe disabled at this time to accomplish them, by reason of the grant I haue made to the Princesse that comes with vs, and the law of armes doth compell me to accomplish my word, rather then my will? on the one side I am assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vrged by a desire to go and see my Ladie: on the other, my promised faith, and the glory that I shall winne in this enterprize doe incite and call me away. But that which I resolue to doe, is to trauaile with all speede that I may quickly arriue to the place where that Giant is,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:173111:179"/> and will cut off his head at my comming, and when I haue peaceably installed the Princesse in her Kingdome, will presently returne to see the light that doth lighten my senses; to whom I will yeeld such forcible reasons of my so long absence, as she shall easily condescend to excuse my stay, seeing all doth redound to her glory and same. For all that I haue gained, doe winne, or shall hereafter atchieue by force of armes in this life, proceedes wholy from the gracious fauor she pleaseth to bestow vpon me, &amp; my being hers. O God! quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> I perceiue that you are greatly diseased in the pate. I pray you Sir tell me whether you mean to go this long voyage for nought? And let slip and lose so rich and so noble a preferment as this? where the dowrie is a Kingdome, which is in good faith as I haue heard say, twentie thousand leagues in compasse. And most plentifully stored with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the sustaining of humane life: and that it is greater then <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Castile</hi> ioyned together? peace for Gods loue, and blush at your owne words, and take my counsaile, and marry presently in the first village that hath a parish Priest: and if you will not doe it there, can you wish a better commodity then to haue our owne Master Licentiat, who will doe it most excellently. And note that I am old enough to giue counsaile, and that this which I now deliuer is as fit for you, as if it were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast for you in a mould. For a Sparrow in the fist, is worth more then a flying Bittor,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For he that can haue good, and euill doth chuse,</l>
                  <l>For ill that betides him, must not patience loose.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Why <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> if thou giuest me coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile to marry to the end I may become a King after I haue slaine the Giant, and haue commoditie thereby to promote thee, and giue thee what I haue promised: I let thee to vnderstand that I may doe all that most easily without marrying my self. For before I enter into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, I will make this condition, that when I come away
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:173111:180"/> victor, although I marry not the Princesse, yet shall a part of the Kingdome bee at my disposition, to bestow vpon whom I please; and when I receiue it, vpon whom wouldest thou haue me bestow it but on thy selfe? that is manifest said <hi>Sancho:</hi> but I pray you Sir haue care to chuse that part you would reserue towards the Seaside, to the end that if the liuing doe not please me, I may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke my blacke vassailes, and make the benefit of them which I haue said. And likewise I pray you not to trouble your minde, thinking to goe and see my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea</hi> at this time; but trauaile towards the place where the Giant is, and kill him, and conclude that businesse first, for I sweare vnto you that I am of opiniō it will proue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of very great honour and profit. I assure thee <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> thou art in the right, and I will follow thy counsaile in rather going first with the Princesse, then to visite <hi>Dulcinea.</hi> And I warne thee not to speake a word to any bodie, no not to those that ride with vs of that which we haue heere spoken and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed together, for since <hi>Dulcinea</hi> is so warie and secret, as she would not haue her thoughts discouered, it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that I either by my selfe or any other should detect them.</p>
               <p>If that be so quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> why then doe you send all those which you vanquish by vertue of your arme to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselues to my Ladie <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> seeing this is as good as subsignatiō of your hands writing, that you wish her well, and are enamored on her? and seeing that those which goe to her, must forcibly lay them downe on their knees before her presence, and say that they come from you to doe her homage, how then can the thoughts of you both be hidden and concealed? O! how great a foole art thou, and how simple quoth <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> Dost not thou perceiue <hi>Sancho,</hi> how all this results to her greater glory. For thou oughtest to wit, that in our knightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, it is great honour that one Ladie alone, haue
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:173111:180"/> many knights errant for her seruitors, without extending their thoughts any further then to serue her, only for her high worthes, without tending any other reward of their many and good desires, then that she will deigne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them as her seruants and knights. I haue heard preach said <hi>Sancho</hi> that men should loue our Sauiour with that kinde of loue, onely for his owne sake, without being moued thereunto, eyther by the hope of glorie, or the feare of paine, although for my part I would loue and serue him, for what he is able to doe. The Diuell take thee for a clowne, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> how sharpe and pertinently dost thou speake now and then? able to make a man imagine that thou hast studied. Now by mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> perceiuing them drowned thus in their discourse, cried out to them to stay and drinke of a little fountaine that was by the way. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to <hi>Sanchoes</hi> verie great contentment, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tyred with telling him so many lies, and was affraid his Master would intrappe him in his owne words. For although he knew <hi>Dulcinea</hi> to be of <hi>Toboso,</hi> yet had hee neuer seene her in his life. And <hi>Cardenio</hi> had by this time done on the apparrel <hi>Dorotea</hi> wore when they found her in the mountaines, which though they were not verie good, yet exceeded with great aduantage those which he had himselfe before. And allighting hard by the fountaine they satisfied with the prouision the Curate had brought with him from the Inne, although it were but little, the great hunger that pressed them. And whilest they tooke their ease there, a certaine young stripling that trauelled passed by, who looking very earnestly on all those which sate about the fountaine, he ranne presently after to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and imbracing his legs, he said weeping downe right: O my Lord doe not you know me? Looke well vpon me, for I am the youth <hi>Andrew,</hi> whom you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed from the Oake whereunto I was tied. <hi>Don Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:173111:181"/> presently knew him, and taking him by the handes, hee turned to those that were present, and saide, because you may see of how great importance it is, that there bee Knights errant in the world, to vndoe wrongs and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that are committed in it by the insolent and badde men which liue therein, you shall witte that a few daies past as I rode through a wood, I heard certaine lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble scritches and cries, as of some needfull and afflicted person: I forthwith occurd, borne away by my profession towards the place from whence the lamentable voyce sounded, &amp; I found tied to an Oake tree, this boy whom you see heere in our presence; for which I am maruellous glad, because If I shall not say the truth, he may checke me. I say that he was tied to the Oake starke naked from thē middle vpward, and a certain clowne was opening his flesh with cruell blowes that he gaue him with the reines of a bridle; which clowne as I after vnderstood, was his Master. And so soone as I saw him, I demaunded the cause of those cruell stripes. The rude fellow answered that he beate him because he was his seruant, and that certaine negligences of his proceeded rather from being a thiefe, then of simplicitie. To which this child answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Sir, he whips me for no other cause, but by reason that I demaund my wages of him. His Master replied, I know not now what speeches and excuses, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I heard, yet were they not by me admitted. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution I caused him to be loosed, and tooke the clownes oath, that he would take him home, and pay him there his wages, one Riall vpon another; I and those also perfumed. Is it not true, sonne <hi>Andrew?</hi> Didst not thou note with what a domineering countenance I commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did it, and with what humilitie he promised to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish all that I imposed, commaunded, and desired? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere me, be not ashamed, nor stagger at all, but tell what passed to the Gentlemen, to the end it may be manifestly seene how necessarie it is as I haue said to haue Knights errant vp and downe the high waies.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:173111:181"/>
               <p>All that which you haue said quoth the boy is verie true, but the end of the matter succeeded altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that which you imagine. How contrarie quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> Why hath not the peasant paid thee? He not onely hath not payed me, answered the boy, but rather as soone as you were passed the wood, and that we remained both alone, he turned againe and tied me to the same tree, and gaue me a fresh so many blowes, as I remained another S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> all fleaed: and at euery blow he said some iest or other in derision of you: so that if I had not felt the paine of the stripes so much as I did, I could haue found in my heart to haue laughed very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. In fine, he left me in such pitifull case, as I haue beene euer since curing my self in an Hospitall of the euill, which the wicked peasant did then vnto me. And you are in the fault of all this, for if you had ridden on your way, and not come to the place where you were not sought for, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled your selfe in other mens affaies, perhaps my Master had contented himselfe with giuing me a dozen or two of strokes, and would presently after haue loosed me, and payed me my wages. But by reason you dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him so much without cause, and said to him so many villanies, his choler was inflamed, and seeing hee could not reuenge it on you, finding himselfe alone, he disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the shower on me so heauily, as I greatly feare that I shall neuer againe be mine owne man. The hurt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in my departure (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> for I should not haue gone from thence, vntill I had seene thee payed. For I might haue very well knowne by many experiences <q>that there is no clowne that will keepe his word, if he see the keeping of it can turne any way to his damage.</q> But yet <hi>Andrew</hi> thou dost remember how I swore that if he paid thee not, I would returne and seeke him out, and likewise finde him, although he conueyed himselfe into a Whales belly. Thats true, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> but all auailes not: thou shalt see whether it auailes or no presently,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:173111:182"/> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and saying so, got vp very hastily, and commaunded <hi>Sancho</hi> to bridle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who was feeding whilest they did eare: <hi>Dorotea</hi> demaunded of him what he meant to doe? He answered that he would goe to finde out the villaine, and punish him for vsing bad proceedings, and cause <hi>Andrew</hi> to be paid the last denier, in despite of as many pesants as in liued the world. To which she answered, intreating him to remember that he could not deale with any other aduenture according to his promise, vntill hers were atchieued, and seeing that he himselfe knew it to be true better then any other, that he should pacifie himselfe, vntill his returne from her Kingdome. You haue reason, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and therefore <hi>Andrew</hi> must haue patience perforce vntill my returne (as you haue said Madame) and when I shall turne againe I doe sweare vnto him, and likewise renew my promise, neuer to rest vntill he be satisfied and payed. I beleeue not in such oathes, quoth <hi>Andrew,</hi> but would haue as much money as might carry me to <hi>Siuill,</hi> rather then all the reuenges in the world. Giue me some meate to eate, and carrie away with me, and God be with you and all other Knights errant, and I pray God that they may proue as erring to themselues as they haue beene to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> tooke out of his bagge a piece of bread and cheese, and giuing it to the youth said, hold brother <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> for euery one hath his part of your misfortune. I pray you what part thereof haue you, said <hi>Andrew?</hi> This piece of bread and cheese that I bestow on thee, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for God onely knowes whether I shall haue need of it againe or no: for thou must wit friend, that we the Squires of Knights errant, are very subiect to great hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and euill lucke, yea and to other things which are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter selt then told: <hi>Andrew</hi> laid hold on his bread and cheese; and seeing that no bodie gaue him any other thing, he bowed his head, and went on his way. True it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:173111:182"/> is that he said to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> at his departure: for Gods loue good Sir Knight errant, if you shall euer meet me againe in the plight you haue done, although you should see mee torne in pieces, yet do not succour or helpe me, but leaue me in my disgrace; for it cannot be so great, but that a greater will result from your helpe, vpon whom and all the other Knights errant that are borne in the world, I pray God his curse may alight. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> thought to arise to chastise him, but he ran away so swiftly, as no man durst follow him; and our Knight remained maruellously ashamed at <hi>Andrews</hi> tale: wherefore the rest with much ado supprest their desire to laugh, lest they should throughly confound him.</p>

And scarce was he gotten into his chamber, when the Hostesse leaping suddenly on the Barber, and taking him by the beard, said, now by my selfe blissed, thou shalt vse my taile no more for a beard, and thou shalt turne me my taile; for my husbands combe goes throwen vp and down the flowre, that it is ashamed to see it: I meane the combe that I was wont to hang vp in my good taile. The Barber would not giue it vnto her for all her drawing, vntill the Licenciate bad him to restore it, that they had now no more vse thereof, but that he might now very well discouer himselfe, and appeare in his owne shape, and say to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that after the Galley-slaues had robd him, he fledde to that Inne: and if <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> demaunded by chaunce for the Princesse her Squire, that they should tel him, how she had sent him before to her kingdome, to giue intelligence to her subiects, that she returned, bringing with her him that should free and giue them all liberty. With this the Barber surrendred the taile willingly to the Hostesse, and likewise all the other borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wares which she had lent for <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> deliuery. All those of the Inne rested wonderfull amazed at <hi>Doroteas</hi> beautie, and also at the comelinesse of the Shepheard <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</hi> Then the Curate gaue order to make readie for them such meat as the Inne could affoord: and the Inkeeper in hope of better payment, did dresse very speedily for them a reasonable good dinner. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> slept all this while, and they were of opinion to let him take his rest, seeing sleepe was more requisite for his disease then meate. At the Table they discoursed (the Inkeeper, his wife, daughter and <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornes,</hi> and all the other trauellers being present) of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> strange frensie, and of the manner wherein they found him. The Hostesse eftsoones recounted what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there betweene him and the Carrier; and looking to see whether <hi>Sancho</hi> were present, perceiuing that hee was away, she tolde likewise all the story of his canuasing, whereat they conceiued no little content and pastime. And as the Curate
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:173111:183"/> said, that the originall cause of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> madnesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the reading of bookes of Knighthood; the In-keeper answered.</p>
               <p>I cannot conceiue how that may be, for (as I beleeue) there is no reading so delightfull in this world: and I my selfe haue two or three bookes of that kinde with other papers, which doe verily keepe me aliue, and not onely mee, but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For in the reaping times, many of the reapers repaire to this place in the heates of mid-day, and there is euermore some one or other among them that can reade, who takes one of these bookes in hand, and then some thirtie or more of vs doe compasse him about, and do listen to him with such pleasure as it hinders a thousand hoary haires: for I dare say at least of my selfe, that when I heare tell of those furious and terrible blowes that kinghts errant giue, it inflames me with a desire to become such a one my selfe, and could finde in my heart to be hearing of them day and night. I am iust of the same minde no more, nor no lesse, said the hostesse, for I neuer haue any quiet houre in my house, but when thou art hearing those bookes whereon thou art so besotted, as then thou doest onely forget to chide, which is thy ordinarie exercise at other times. That is very true said <hi>Maritornes.</hi> And I in good sooth doe take great delight to heare those things, for they are very fine and especially when they tell how such a Ladie lies embraced by her Knight vnder an Orange tree, and that a certaine Damsell kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth watch all the while, readie to burst; for enuie that she hath not likewise her sweet heart: And very much afraid. I say that all those things are as sweete as honey to me. And you quoth the Curate to the Inkeepers daughter what doe you thinke? I know not in good sooth Sir quoth she, but I doe likewise giue eare, and in truth although I vnderstand it not, yet doe I take some pleasure to heare them, but I mislike greatly those blowes, which please my father so much: and onely delight in the lamentations that knightes make being absent from their Ladies: which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:173111:184"/> in sooth doe now and then make mee weepe through the compassion I take of them. Well then quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> belike faire Maiden you would remedie them, if such plaints were breathed for your owne sake? I know not what I would doe answered the Gyrle, onely this I know, that there are some of those Ladies so cruell, as their Knights call them <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> and a thousand other wild beasts. And <hi>good Iesus,</hi> I knew not what vnsouled folk they bee, and so without cōscience, that because they wil not once behold an honoru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, they suffer him either to die or run mad. And I know not to what end serues all that coynesse. For if they do it for honesties sake, let thē marry with them, for the knights desire nothing more: Peace child quoth the hostesse, for it seemes that thou knewest too much of those matters, and it is not decent that maidens should know or speake so much; I speake quoth she, by reason that this good Sir made me the demaund. And I could not in courtesie omit to answere him: Well said the Curate, let me entreate you good mine host to bring vs here those books, for I would faine see them.</p>
               <p>I am pleased said the Inkeeper, and then entring into his chamber he brought forth a little old Mallet shut vp with a chaine, &amp; opening thereof, he tooke out three great bookes and certaine papers written with a very faire letter. The first booke he opened was that of <hi>Don Cirongilio of Thracia.</hi> The other <hi>Felixmarte of Hircania:</hi> And the third, <hi>The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the great Captaine, Goncalo Hernandez of Cordoua</hi> with the life of <hi>Diego Garcia of Paredes,</hi> adioyned, as soone as the Curate had read the titles of the two bookes, hee said to the Barber, we haue now great want of our friends the old woman and Neece: not so much as you thinke quoth the Barber, for I knew also the way to the yard, or the chimney, and in good sooth, there is a fire in it good enough for that purpose. Would you then quoth the host burne my bookes? no more of them quoth the Curate, but these first two of <hi>Don Cirongilio</hi> and <hi>Felixmarte,</hi> are my bookes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps quoth the Inkeeper hereticall or flegmaticall that you
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:173111:184"/> would thus roughly handle them? Schismaticall thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue said quoth the Barber, and not flegmaticall. It is so said the Inkeeper, but if you will needs burne any, I pray you rather let it be that of the <hi>great Captaine,</hi> &amp; of that <hi>Diego Garcia,</hi> for I would rather suffer one of my sonnes to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then any one of those other two. Good friend these two bookes are lying and full of follies and vanities, but that <hi>of the great Captaine</hi> is true, and containeth the artes of <hi>Goncalo Hernandez of Cordoua:</hi> who for his sundrie and noble actes, merited to be termed by all the world, <hi>The great Captaine,</hi> a name famous, illustrious, and onely descrued by himselfe, and this other <hi>Diego Garcia</hi> of <hi>Paredes</hi> was a noble Gentleman, borne in the Citie of <hi>Truxillo in Estremadura,</hi> and was a most valorous souldier, and of so surpassing force as he would detaine a mill wheele with one hand from tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the midst of the speediest motion: and standing once at the end of a bridge with a two handed sword, defended the passage against a mightie armie that attempted to passe ouer it: and did so many other things, that if another, who were a stranger and vnpassionate had written them, as he did himselfe who was the relater and historiographer of his owne actes, and therefore recounted them with the modestie of a Gentleman, and proper Chronicler; they would haue drowned all the <hi>Hectors, Achillises</hi> and <hi>Rollands</hi> in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion.</p>
               <p>There is a iest quoth the Inkeeper, deale with my father I pray you, see at what you wonder. A wise tale, at the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the wheele of a mill. I sweare you ought to read that which is read in <hi>Felixmarte</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> who with one twhart blow cut fiue mightie Giants in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lfes, as if they were of beanes, like to the little Friers that children make of bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cods. And set an other time vpon a great and most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full armie of more then a million and sixe hundred thousand souldiers, and ouerthrew and scattered them all like a flocke of sheepe. What then can you say to me of the good <hi>Don Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thracia,</hi> who was so animous and valiant as may
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:173111:185"/> be seene in his booke: wherein is laid downe, that as he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led along a Riuet there issued out of the middest of the water a serpenr, of fire, and hee as soone as hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, leaped vpon her, and hanging by her squamie shoulders he wroong her throat so straitly betweene both his armes, that the serpent perceiuing her selfe to bee well nigh strangled, had no other way to saue her selfe, but by diuing down into the deeps, carrying the knight away with her, who would neuer let goe his gripe, and when they came to the bottome, he found himselfe by a Pallace in such faire and pleasant gardens, as it was a wonder: and presently the Serpent turned into an old man, which said to him such things as there is no more to be desired. Two figs for the <hi>great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> and that <hi>Diego Garcia,</hi> of whom you speake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorotea</hi> hearing him speake thus, said to <hi>Cardenio,</hi> mee thinkes our host wants but little to make vp a second part of <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> So it seemes to me likewise replied <hi>Cardenio,</hi> for as we may coniecture by his words, he certainly beleeues that euery thing written in those bookes passed iust as it is laid downe, and barefooted friers would be scarce able toper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him the contrary. Know friend (quoth the Curate to the Inkeeper) that there was neuer any such mā as <hi>Felixmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> or <hi>Don Cirongilio</hi> of <hi>Thracia,</hi> nor other such knights, as books of Chiualry recount. For all is but a deuice and fiction of idle wits that composed them, to the end that thou sayest, to passe ouer the time as your readers do in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thē. For I sincerely sweare vnto thee, that there were neuer such knights in the world, nor such aduentures and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings hapned in it. Cast that bone to another dog quoth the Inkeeper, as though I knew not how many numbers are fiue, and where the shoe wrests me now. I pray you Sir goe not about to giue me pappe, for by the Lord I am not so white. Is it not a good sport that you labour to perswade mee that al that which these good books say, are but rauings &amp; fables, they being printed by grace &amp; priuiledge of the Lords of the priuie Counsell; as if they were folke that would permit-so
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:173111:185"/> many lies to be printed at once: and so many battels and inchantments, as are able to make a man runne out of his wits. I haue told thee already friend (said the Curate) that this is done for the recreation of our idle thoughts: and so euen as in welgouernd cōmonwealths the plaies of Chesse, Tennis and Trucks are tollerated for the pastime of some men, which haue none other occupation, and either ought not, or cannot work: euen so such books are permitted to be printed: presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, (as intruth they ought) that no man would be found so simple &amp; ignorant, as to hold any of these bookes for a true history. And if my leasure permitted &amp; that it were a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for this auditory, I could say many things cōcerning the subiect of books of knighthood, to the end that they should be well contriued, and also be pleasant and profitable to the readers: but I hope somtime to haue the commoditie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my conceit with those that may redresse it. And in the meane while you may beleeue good mine host what I haue said, and take to you your bookes, and agree with their truthes or leasings as you please, and much good may it doe you. And I pray God that you hault not in time on the foot that your guest <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> halteth. Nor so quoth the In-keeper, for I will neuer be so wood as to become a Knight errant, for I see well, that what was vsed in the times of these famous knights, is now in no vse nor request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> came in about the midst of this discourse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted much confounded and pensatiue of that which he heard them say, that knights errant were now in no request, and that the bookes of Chiualry, onely contained follies and lies: and purposed with himselfe to see the end of that one voyage of his Lords, and that if it sorted not the wished successe which he expected, he resolued to leaue him, and returne home to his wife and children, and accustomed labour. The Inkeeper thought to take away his bookes and budget, but the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate withheld him saying, stay a while, for I would see what papers are those which are written in so faire a character. The host tooke thē out &amp; gaue them to him to read, being in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:173111:186"/> number some eight sheets with a title written in text letters, which said, <hi>The Historie of the curious impertinent:</hi> The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate read two or three lines softly to himselfe, and said after, truly the title of this History doth not mislike mee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am about to read it through. The Inkeeper hearing him said, your reuerence may very well do it, for I assure you that some guests which haue read it here as they trauelled, did commend it exceedingly, and haue begd it of me as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but I would neuer bestow it, hoping some day to restore it to the owner of this Mallet, who forgot it heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him with these bookes and papers, for it may be that hee will sometime returne, and although I know that I shall haue great want of the bookes, yet will I make to him restitution, for although I am an Inkeeper, yet God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked I am a Christian therewithall. You haue great reason my friend quoth the Curate, but yet notwithstanding if the tast like me, thou must giue me leaue to take a copie thereof; withall my heart replied the host. And as they two talked, <hi>Cardenio</hi> taking the booke began to reade a little of it, and it pleasing him as much as it had done the Curate, he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him to read it in such sort as they might al heare him: that I would willingly doe said the Curate, if the time were not now more fit for sleeping then reading. It were sufficient repose for me said <hi>Dorotea,</hi> to passe away the time listening to some tale or other, for my spirit is not yet so well quieted, as to affoord me licence to sleepe, euen then when nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth it. If that be so quoth the Curate, I will read it if it were but for curiositie, perhaps it containeth some delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter. Master <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> intreated the same; the Curate seeing and knowing that he should therein doe them all a pleasure, and he himselfe likewise receiue as great, said, seeing you will needs heare it, be all of you attentiue, for the Historie beginneth in this manner.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is rehearsed the Historie of the curious imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Florence</hi> a rich and famous Citie of <hi>Italie,</hi> in the Prouince called <hi>Tuscane,</hi> there dwelled two rich and principall Gentlemen called <hi>Anselmo</hi> and <hi>Lothario,</hi> which two were so great friends, as they were named for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency &amp; by <hi>Antonomasia,</hi> by al those that knew them, the two friends. They were both batchelers, and much of one age and manners; all which was of force to make them answere one another with reciprocall amity. True it is, that <hi>Anselmo</hi> was somewhat more inclined to amorous daliance then <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario,</hi> who was altogether addicted to hunting. But when occasion exacted it, <hi>Anselmo</hi> would omit his owne pleasures to satisfie his friends, and <hi>Lothario</hi> likewise his, to please <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo.</hi> And by this meanes both, their wils were so corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent, as no clocke could be better ordred then were their desires. <hi>Anselmo</hi> became at last deepely enamoured of a principall and beautifull young Ladie of the same Citie, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Camila,</hi> being so worthily descended, and she her selfe of such merite therewithall, as he resolued (by the consent of his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> without whom he did nothing) to demaund her of her parents for wife, and did put his purpose in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and <hi>Lothario</hi> himselfe was the messenger, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the matter so to his friends satisfaction, as he was shortly after put in possession of his desires: and <hi>Camila</hi> so conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue gotten <hi>Anselmo,</hi> as she ceased not to render Heauen and <hi>Lothario</hi> thankes, by whose meanes she had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so good a match. The first dayes, as all marriage daies are wont to be merry; <hi>Lothario</hi> frequented according to the custome, his friend <hi>Anselmos</hi> house, endeuouring to honor, feast and recreat him all the wayes he might possible, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:173111:187"/> the Nuptials were finished, and the concourse of strangers visitations and congratulations somewhat ceased, <hi>Lothario</hi> also began to be somewhat more slacke then he wonted in going to <hi>Anselmo</hi> his house, deeming it (as it is reason that all discreet men should) not so conuenient to visite or haunt so often the house of his friend after marriage, as he would, had he still remained a Batcheler. For although true amitie neyther should, or ought to admit the least suspition: yet notwithstanding a married mans honour is so delicate and tender a thing, as it seemes it may be sometimes impayred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by very brethren, and how much more by friends. <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> noted the remisnes of <hi>Lothario,</hi> and did grieuously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine thereof, saying, that if he had wist by marriage he should thus be depriued of his deerest conuersation, he would neuer haue married; and that since through the vniforme correspondencie of them both being free, they had deserued the sweet title of <hi>the two friends,</hi> that he should not now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (because he would be noted circumspect without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion) that so famous and pleasing a name should be lost: and therefore he requested him (if it were lawfull to vse such a terme betweene them two) to returne and be Master of his house, and come and goe out of it, as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his marriage, assuring him that his Spouse <hi>Camila</hi> had no other pleasure and will, then that which himselfe pleased she should haue: and that she, after hauing knowne how great was both their friendships, was not a little amazed to see him become so strange.</p>
               <p>To all these and many other reasons alleaged by <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> to perswade <hi>Lothario</hi> to frequent his house: he answered with so great prudence, discretion and warinesse, as <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> remained satisfied of his friends good intention herein: and they made an agreement betweene them two, that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario</hi> should dine at his house twice a weeke, and the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies besides. And although this agreement had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, yet <hi>Lothario</hi> purposed to do that onely which he should finde most expedient for his friends honour, whose
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:173111:187"/> reputation he tendered much more deerely then he did his owne; and was wont to say very discreetely, that the married man vnto whom heauen had giuen a beautifull wife, ought to haue as much heede of the friends which hee brought to his house, as he should of the women friends that visited his wife, for that which is not done nor agreed vpon in the Church or Market, nor in publike feasts or stations (being places that a man cannot lawfully hinder his wife from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting sometimes at least) are oft-times facilitated, and contriued in a friends or kinsewomans house, whom perhaps we neuer suspected. <hi>Anselmo</hi> on the other side affirmed, that therefore married men ought euery one of them to haue some friend who might aduertise them of the faults escaped in their manner of proceeding; for it befals many times, that through the great loue which the husband beares towards his wife, eyther he doth not take notice, or else he doth not aduertise her, because he would not offend her to doe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to doe certaine things, the doing or omitting whereof, might turne to his honour or obloquie: to which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertised by his friend hee might easily apply some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: but where might a man find a friend so discreet, loyal and trustie as <hi>Anselmo</hi> demaunds? I know not truely, if not <hi>Lothario;</hi> for he it was that with all solicitude and care re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the honour of his friend: and therefore endeuoured to clip and diminish the number of the dayes promised, lest he should giue occasion to the idle vulgar, or to the eyes of vagabonds and malitious men to iudge any finister thing, viewing so rich, comely, noble, and qualified a young man as he was, to haue so free acccsse into the house of a woman so beautifull as <hi>Camila.</hi> For though his vertues and modest carriage were sufficiently able to set a bridle to any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant tongue, yet notwithstanding he would not haue his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, nor that of his friends called into any question, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would spend most of the dayes that he had agreed, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site his friend, in other places and exercises; yet fayning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses so plausible, as his friend admitted them for very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:173111:188"/> And thus the time passed on in challenges of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse of the one side, and lawfull excuses of the other.</p>
               <p>It so fell out, that as both the friends walked on a day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a field without the Citie, <hi>Anselmo</hi> said to <hi>Lothario</hi> these words ensuing. I know very well friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> that among all the fauours which God of his bounty hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon me, by making me the sonne of such parents, and guing to me with so liberall a hand, both the goods of Nature and Fortune. Yet as I cannot answere him with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient gratitude for the benefits alreadie receiued, so doe I finde my selfe most highly bound vnto him aboue all others for hauing giuen me such a friend as thou art, and so beautifull a wife as <hi>Camila;</hi> being both of you such pawnes as if I esteeme you not in the degree which I ought, yet doe I hold you as deere as I may. And yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing all those things which are wont to bee the all and some that are wont, and may make a man happy, I liue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the most sullen and discontented life of the world. Being troubled I know not since when and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrested with so strange a desire, and extrauagant from the common vse of others, as I maruaile at my selfe, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and rebuke my selfe when I am alone, and doe labour to conceale and couer mine owne desires, all which hath ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to as little effect, as if I had proclaimed mine owne errors purposely to the world. And seeing that it must final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake out, my will is that it bee onely communicated to the treasury of thy secret. Hoping that by it and mine owne industrie which (as my true friend) thou wilt vse to helpe me, I shall be quickly freed from the anguish it causeth, and by thy meanes my ioy and contentment shall arriue to the passe that my discontents haue brought mee through mine owne folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lothario</hi> stood suspended at <hi>Anselmos</hi> speech, as one that could not imagine, to what so prolixe a preuention and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble tended: And although he reuolued and imagined sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things in his mind which hee deemed might afflict his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:173111:188"/> friend, yet did he euer shoore wide from the marke which in truth it was: and that he might quickly escape that agonie, wherin the suspension held him, he said that his friend did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iniurie to their amitie in searching out wreathings and ambages in the discouery of his most hidden thoughts to him, feeing he might assure himselfe certainly, either to receiue counsels of him how to entertaine, or else remedy &amp; meanes how to accomplish them. It is very true, answered <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and with that confidence I let thee to vnderstand friend <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario,</hi> that the desire which vexeth me, is a longing to know whether my wife <hi>Camila</hi> be as good and perfect, as I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her: and I cannot wholy rest satisfied of this truth, but by making triall of her, in such sort, as it may giue manifest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the degree of her goodnesse, as the fire doth shew the value of gold. For I am of opiniō (O friend that a woman) is of no more worth or vertue then that which is in her, after she hath <note n="*" place="margin">Casta est quàm nemo rogauit.</note> bene solicited, &amp; that she alone is strong, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bebowed by the promises, gifts, teares, &amp; cōtinual impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of importunate louers. For what thanks is it (quoth he) for a woman to be good, if no bodie say or teach her ill? What wonder that she be retired and timerous, if no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be ministred to her of dissolution, and chiefly she that knowes she hath a husband readie to kill her, for the least ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of lightnesse? So that she which is onely good for feare, or want of occasion, will I neuer hold in that estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I would the other sollicited and pursued, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding comes away crowned with the victory. And therefore being moued as well by these reasons, as by many other, which I could tell you, which accredite and fortifie mine opinion, I desire that my wife <hi>Camila</hi> doe also passe through the pikes of those proofes and difficulties, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and refine her selfe in the fire of being requested, solicited and pursued; and that by one whose worthes and valour may deserue acceptance in her opinion: and if she beare away the Palme of the victory, as I beleeue she will, I shall acount my fortune matchlesse, and may brag that my desires are in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:173111:189"/> their height: and will say that a strong woman hath falne to my lot, of whom the wise man saith, <hi>Who shall finde her?</hi> and when it shall succeede contrary to mine expectation, I shall with the pleasure that I will conceiue to see how rightly it iumps with mine opiniō, beare very indifferēt the grief which in all reason, this so costly a triall must stir in me. And presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that nothing which thou shalt say to me, shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to hinder my designe, or disswade me from putting my purpose in execution; I would haue thy selfe deere friend <hi>Lothario</hi> to prouide thee to be the instrument, that shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour this worke of my liking, and I will giue thee oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie enough to performe the same without omitting any thing that may further thee in the solicitation of an honest, noble, warie, retired, and passionlesse wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>And I am chiefly moued to cōmit this so hard an enterprize to thy trust, because I know that if <hi>Camila</hi> be vanquished by thee yet shall not the victory arriue to the last push &amp; vpshot, but onely to that of accounting a thing to bee done, which shall not be done for many good respects. So shall I remaine nothing offended, and mine iniury concealed in the vertue of thy silence; for I know thy care to be such in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mee, as it shall be eternall like that of death. And therfore if thou desirest that I may leade a life, deseruing that name, thou must forthwith prouide thy selfe to enter into this amorous conflict, and that not languishing or slouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with that courage and diligence which my desire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth, and the confidence I haue in our amitie assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me.</p>
               <p>These were the reasons vsed by <hi>Anselmo</hi> to <hi>Lothario,</hi> to all which he was so attentiue as vntill he ended, hee did not once vnfold his lippes to speake a word saue those which we haue aboue related: and seeing that he spoke no more; after he had beheld him a good while, as a thing that he had neuer before, and did therefore strike him into admiration and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, he said. Friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> I cannot perswade my
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:173111:189"/> selfe, that the words you haue spoken be other then iests, for had I thought that thou wert in earnest, I would not haue suffered thee to passe on so farre, and by lending thee no eare, would haue excused this tedious Oration. I doe verily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that either thou doest not know me, or I thee: but not so: for I know thee to bee <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and thou, that I am <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio:</hi> the dammage is, that I thinke thou art not the <hi>Anselme</hi> thou wast wont to bee, and perhaps thou deemest me not to be the accustomed <hi>Lothario</hi> that I ought to be: for the things which thou hast spoken are not of that <hi>Anselmo</hi> my friend; nor those which thou seekest, ought to be demaunded of that <hi>Lothario,</hi> of whom thou hast notice. For true friends ought to proue and vse their friends as the <hi>Poet</hi> said, <hi>Vsque ad Aras.</hi> That is, that they should in no sort imploy them or implore their assistance in things offensiue vnto God: and if a Gentile was of this opinion in matters of friendship, how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason is it that a Christian should haue that feeling, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially knowing that the celestiall amitie is not to be lost for any humane friendship whatsoeuer. And when the friend should throw the barres so wide, as to set heauenly respectes apart, for to compliment with his friend, it must not be done on light grounds, or for things of small moment, but rather for those whereon his friends life, &amp; honour wholy depends. Then tell me now <hi>Anselmo</hi> in which of these two things art thou in danger, that I may aduenture my person to doe thee a pleasure; and attempt so detestable a thing as thou doest demaund? none of them truly, but rather doest demaund, as I may coniecture, that I doe industriously labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thee of thine honour and life together, and in doing so, I likewise depriue my selfe of them both. For if I must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to take away thy credit, it is most euident, that I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poile thee of life, for a man without reputation is worse then a dead man: and I being the instrument (as thou desirest that I should be) of so great harme vnto thee, doe not I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come likewise thereby dishonoured, and by the same conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence also without life? Heare mee friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:173111:190"/> haue patience not to answere me vntil I haue said all that I thinke concerning that which thy minde exacteth of thee. For wee shall haue after leasure enough, wherein thou mayest reply, and I haue patience to listen vnto thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>I am pleased quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> say what thou likest: And <hi>Lothario</hi> prosecuted his speech in this manner, me thinks <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> that thou art now of the <hi>Moores</hi> humours, which can by no meanes be made to vnderstand the errour of their sect. Neither by Citations of the holy Scripture, nor by reasons which consist in speculations of the vnderstanding, or that are founded in the Articles of the faith: but must be wonne by palpable examples, and those, easie, intelligible, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue and doubtlesse, by Mathematicall demonstrations which cannot be denied. Euen as when wee say: <hi>If from two equall parts, we take away two parts equall, the parts that remaine are also equall.</hi> And when they cannot vnderstand this, as in truth they do not, we must demonstrate it to them with our hands, and lay it before their eyes, and yet for all this, nought can auaile to winne them in the end to giue credit to the verities of our religion, which very termes and manner of proceeding, I must vse with thee, by reason that the desire which is sprung in thee, doth so wander and stray from all that which beares the shadow onely of reason, as I doubt much that I shall spend my time in vaine, which I shall bestow to make thee vnderstand thine owne simplicity, for I will giue it no other name at this present: and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest I was almost perswaded to leaue thee in thine humour, in punishment of thine inordinate and vnreasonable desire, but that the loue which I beare towards thee doth not consent, I vse to thee such rigour, or leaue thee in so manifest a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thine owne perdition. And that thou maist cleerely see it, tell me <hi>Anselmo,</hi> hast not thou said vnto me that I must solicite one that stands vpon her reputation: perswade an honest woman, make proffers to one that is not passionate or engaged? and serue a discreete woman? yes, thou hast said
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:173111:190"/> all this. Well then, if thou knowest already that thou hast a retyred, honest, vnpassionate, and prudent wife, what seek<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>est thou more? And if thou thinkest that she will rest victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious after all mine assaults, as doubtlesly she will, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter titles wouldest thou after bestow vpon her, then those she possesseth already? eyther it proceeds because thou dost not thinke of her as thou sayest, or els because thou knowest not what thou demaundest. If thou dost not acount her such as thou praysest her, to what end wouldest thou proue her, but rather as an euill person, vse her as thou likest best: but if she be as good as thou beleeuest, it were an impertinent thing to make tryall of truth it selfe. For after it is made, yet it will still rest onely with the same reputation it had before. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a concluding reason that to attempt things whence rather harme may after result vnto vs then good, is the part of rash and discourselesse braines, and principally when they deale with those things whereunto they are not compelled or driuen, and that they see euen a farre off, how the attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like is manifest folly. Difficult things are vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for God, or the world, or both. Those that are done for God are the workes of the Saints, indeauouring to leade Angels liues in fraile and mortall bodies. Those of the world are the trauels and toiles of such as crosse such immense seas, trauell through so aduerse regions, and conuerse with so many nations, to acquire that which wee call the goods of fortune. And the things acted for God and the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the worthy exploits of resolute and valorous marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men, which scarce perceiue so great a breach in the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie wall, as the common billet is wont to make, when lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all feare apart, without making any discourse, or taking notice of the manifest danger that threatens them, borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the wings of desire and honour to serue God, their Nation and Prince, doe throw themselues boldly into the throate of a thousand menacing deathes which expect them.</p>
               <p>These are things wont to be practised, and it is honour,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:173111:191"/> glory and profite to attempt them, be they neuer so full of inconueniences and danger: but that which thou sayest, thou wilt trie and put in practise, shall neuer gaine thee Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the goods of Fortune, or renoune among men: for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that thou bringest it to passe according to thine owne fantasie, thou shalt remaine nothing more contented, rich or honorable then thou art already: and if thou doest not, then shalt thou see thy selfe in the greatest miserie of any wretch liuing: for it will little auaile thee then, to thinke that no man knowes the disgrace befallen thee, it being sufficient both to afflict and dissolue thee, that thou knowest it thy selfe, and for greater confirmation of this truth I will repeate vnto thee a stanza of the famous Poet <hi>Ludouico Tansilo</hi> in the end of his first part of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> teares, which is:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>THe griefe increaseth, and withall the shaine,</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Peter</hi> when the day it selfe did show.</l>
                  <l>And though he no man sees, yet doth he blame,</l>
                  <l>Himselfe because he had offended so:</l>
                  <l>For brests magnanimous not onely tame</l>
                  <l>When that of others, they are seene they know.</l>
                  <l>But of themselues asham'de they often bee,</l>
                  <l>Though none but Heauen and Earth their errour see.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So that thou canst not excuse thy griefe, with secrecie be it neuer so great, but rather shalt haue continuall occasion to weepe, if not watry teares from thine eyes, at least teares of bloud from thy heart, such as that simple Doctor wept, of whom our Poet makes mention, who made triall of the ves<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell, which the prudent <hi>Reynaldos</hi> vpon maturer discourse refused to deale withall: and although it be but a Poeticall fiction yet doth it containe many hidden morals, worthy to be noted, vnderstood and imitated: how much more seeing that by what I meane to say now, I hope thou shalt begin to conceaue the great errour which thou wouldest wittingly commit. Tell me <hi>Anselmo,</hi> if heauen or thy fortunes had
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:173111:191"/> made thee Lord and lawfull possessor of a most precious <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amante,</hi> of whose goodnesse and qualitie all the Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists that had viewed the same would rest satisfied, and that all of them would ioyntly and vniformely affirme that it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in quality, goodnes, and finesse to all that, to which the nature of such a stone might extend it selfe, and that thou thy selfe didst beleeue the same, without witting any thing to the contrary: would it be iust that thou shouldest take an humour to set that <hi>Diamant</hi> betweene an Anuile and a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and to trie there by very force of blowes whether it be so hard and so fine as they say? And farther when thou didst put thy designe in execution, put the case that the stone made resistance to thy foolish triall, yet wouldest thou adde thereby no new valour or esteeme to it: and if it did breake as it might befall, were not then all lost? Yes certainly, and that leauing the owner in all mens opinion for a very poore ignorant person. Then friend <hi>Anselmo,</hi> make account that <hi>Camila</hi> is a most pretious <hi>Diamant,</hi> as well in thine, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens estimation, and it is no reason to put her in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent danger of breaking, seeing that although she remain in her integrity, she cannot mount to more worth then she hath at the present; &amp; if she faltred, or did not resist, consider euen at this present, what state you would be in then, and how iustly thou mightest then complaine of thy selfe, for being cause of her perdition and thine owne? See how there is no jewell in the world comparable to the modest and chaste woman. And that all womens honour consists in the good opinion thats had of them: and seeing that of thy spouse is so great as it arriues to that summe of perfection which thou knowest, why wouldest thou call this verity in question? Know friend that a woman is an imperfect creature, and should therefore haue nothing cast in her way to make her stumble and fall, but rather to cleere, and doe all incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces away out of it, to the end she may without impeachment run with a swift course to obtaine the perfection she wants, which onely consists in being vertuous.</p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:173111:192"/>
               <p>The Naturalists recount, that the <hi>Ermine</hi> is a little beast that hath a most white skinne, and that when the hunters would chase him they vse this art to take him: as soone as they finde out his haunt, and places where he hath recourse, they thwart them with mire and dirt, and after when they discrie the little beast, they pursue him towards those places which are defiled, and the <hi>Erimine</hi> espying the mire standes still, and permits himselfe to be taken and captiued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of not passing through the mire, or stayning of his whitenesse, which it esteemes more then eyther liberty or life. The honest and chaste woman is an Ermine, and the vertue of chastitie is whiter and purer then Snow: and hee that would not lose it, but rather desires to keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it, must proceede with a different stile from that of the <hi>Ermine.</hi> For they must not propose and lay before her the mire of the passions, flatteries and seruices of importunate louers; for perhaps she shall not haue the naturall impulse and force which commonly through proper debility is wont to stumble, to passe ouer those incumbrances safely: and therefore it is requisite to free the passage and take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and lay before her the cleerenesse of vertue, and the beauty comprized in good fame. The good woman is also like vnto a bright and cleere mirrour of <hi>Crystall,</hi> and therfore is subiect to bee stained and dimmed by euery breath that toucheth it. The honest woman is to be vsed as reliques of Saints, to wit, she must be honoured but not touched. The good woman is to be kept and prized like a faire Garden full of sweet flowers and Roses, that is held in estimation; whose owner permits no man to enter and trample, or touch his flowers but holdes it to be sufficient that they standing a farre off without the railes may ioy the delightfull sight, and flagrancie thereof. Finally I will repeat certaine verses vnto thee that haue now come to my memorie, the which were repeated of late in a new play, and seeme to me very fit for the purpose of which we treat. A prudent olde man did giue a neighbour of his that had a daughter, counsaile to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:173111:192"/> keepe and shut her vp: and among many other reasons hee vsed these.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>TRuely woman is of glasse,</l>
                  <l>Therefore no man ought to trie</l>
                  <l>If she broke or not might bee,</l>
                  <l>Seeing all might come to passe.</l>
                  <l>Yet to breake her tis more easie,</l>
                  <l>And it is no wit to venter</l>
                  <l>A thing of so brittle temper,</l>
                  <l>That to saulder is so queasie.</l>
                  <l>And I would haue all men dwell</l>
                  <l>In this truth, and reasons ground,</l>
                  <l>That if <hi>Danaes,</hi> may be found</l>
                  <l>Golden showers are found as well.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>All that which I haue said to thee <hi>Anselmo</hi> vntill this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant hath beene for that, which may touch thy selfe: and it is now high time that somewhat be heard concerning me. And if by chance I shall be somewhat prolixe, I pray thee to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me; for the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> wherein thou hast entred, and out of which thou wouldest haue me to free thee requires no lesse. Thou holdest me to be thy friend, and yet goest about to dispoyle me of mine honour, being a thing contrary to all amitie; and dost not onely pretend this, but dost likewise indeauour that I should robbe thee of the same, that thou wouldest depriue me of mine is euident; for when <hi>Camila</hi> shall perceiue that I sollicite her as thou demaundest, it is certaine that she will esteeme of me, as of one quite deuoide of wit and indiscreete, seeing I intend and doe a thing so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that, which the being that him I am, and thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie doe binde me vnto; that thou wouldest haue me rob thee thereof is as manifest, for <hi>Camila</hi> seeing mee thus to court her, must imagine that I haue noted some lightnesse in her, which lent me boldnes thus to discouer vnto her my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued desires, and she holding her selfe to be thereby iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:173111:193"/> and dishonoured, her disgrace must also concerne thee as a principall part of her. And hence springs that which is commonly said, that the husband of the adulterous wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he know nothing of her lewdnesse, nor hath giuen any occasion to her to doe what she ought not, nor was able any way to hinder by diligence, care, or other means his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, yet is intituled with a vituperious and vile name, and is in a manner beheld by those that know his wiues malice with the eyes of contempt; whereas they should indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him rather with those of compassion, seeing that hee fals into that misfortune, not so much through his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, as through the light santasie of his wicked confort. But I will shew thee the reason why a badde womans husband is iustly dishonoured and contemned, although he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and guiltlesse thereof, and cannot preuent nor hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to it any occasion. And be not grieued to heare me, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefite of the discourse shall redound vnto thy selfe.</p>
               <p>When God created our first parent in the terrestriall <hi>Paradice,</hi> the holy Scripture saith, <hi>that God infused sleepe into Adam,</hi> and that being asleepe he tooke out a ribbe out of his left side, of which hee formed our mother <hi>Eue,</hi> and as soone as <hi>Adam</hi> awaked and beheld her he said, this is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bones. And God said, for this shall a man leaue his father and his mother, and they fhall be two in one flesh, and then was the diuine Sacrament of Matrimonie first instituted, with such indissoluble knots, as onely may be by death dissolued. And this maruellous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is of such efficacie and force, as it makes two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent persons to be one very flesh, and yet operates farther in good married folke: For although they haue two soules, yet it makes them to haue but one will. And hence it proceeds, that by reason the wiues flesh is one and the very same with her husbands, the blemishes or defects that taint it, doe also redound into the husbands, although he (as we haue said) haue ministred no occasion to receiue that dammage. For
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:173111:193"/> as all the whole body feeles any paine of the foote, head or any other member, because it is all one flesh: and the head smarts at the griefe of the Ancle, although it hath not caused it, so is the husband participant of his wiues dishonour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is one and the selfesame with her. And by reason that all the honours and dishonours of the world are, and spring from flesh and bloud; and those of the badde woman be of this kinde, it is forcible, that part of them fall to the husbands share, and that he be accounted dishonourable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he wholly be ignorant of it. See then <hi>Anselmo</hi> to what perill thou doest thrust thy selfe, by seeking to disturbe the quietnesse and repose wherein thy wife liues: and for how vain &amp; impertinent curiositie thou wouldest stir vp the humors which are now quiet in thy chaste spouses brest; note how the things thou dost aduenture to gaine, is of smal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that which thou shalt lose so great, that I must leaue it in his point, hauing no wordes sufficiently able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deere it. But if all that I haue said be not able to moue thee from thy badde purpose: thou mayest well seeke out for some other instrument of thy dishonour and mishaps: for I meane not to be one, although I should therefore lose thine amitie, which is the greatest losse that might any way befall mee.</p>
               <p>Here the prudent <hi>Lothario</hi> held his peace, and <hi>Anselmo</hi> remained so confounded and melancholie, as hee could not answere a word to him, for a very great while. But in the end he said. I haue listned friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> to all that which thou hast said vnto mee, with the attention which thou hast noted. And haue perceiued in thy reasons, examples, &amp; simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, the great discretion wherewithall thou art indowed, and the perfection of amitie that thou hast attained: and do also confesse and see, that if I follow not thine aduice, but should leaue vnto mine owne, I doe but shunne the good and pursue the euill. Yet oughtest thou likewise to consider how herein I suffer the disease which some women are wont to haue that long to eate earth, lime, coales, and other far
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:173111:194"/> worse and loathsome things; euen to the very sight, and much more to the taste. So that it is behouefull to vse some arte by which I may be cured, and this might be easily done, by beginning only to solicite <hi>Camila</hi> although you did it but weake and fainedly: for I know shee will not be so soft and pliable, as to dash her honestie about the ground at the first encounters, and I will rest satisfied with this commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone: and thou shalt herein accomplish the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou owest to our friendship, by not only restoring mee to life, but also by perswading me not to dispoile my selfe of mine honour. And thou art bound to doe this for one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that I shall alledge, to wit, that I being resolued as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am to make this experience, thou oughtst not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit being my friend that I should bewray my defect herein to a stranger, whereby I might very much indanger my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which thou labourest so much to preserue, and though thy credit may lose some degrees in <hi>Camilas</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst thou dost solicite her, it matters not very much or rather nothing; for very shortly, when we shall espie in her the integritie that we expect, thou maist open vnto her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely the drift of our practice, by which thou shalt againe recouer thine impaired reputation. Therefore seeing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture is little, and the pleasure thou shalt doe mee by the enterprising thereof so, too great, I pray thee do it, though euer so many incumbrances represent themselues to thee, for (as I haue promised) with only thy beginning, I will rest satisfied and account the cause concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lothario</hi> perceauing the firme resolution of <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and nothing else occurring forcibly disswasiue, nor knowing what other reasons to vse, that might hinder this his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate resolution: and noting withall how hee threatned to breake the matter of this his indiscreet desires to a stranger: he determined to auoid greater inconuencies to giue him satisfaction, and performe his demaund, with purpose and resolution to guide the matter so discreetly, as without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Camila's</hi> thoughts, <hi>Anselmo</hi> should rest contented,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:173111:194"/> and therefore intreated him not to open his minde to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for he himselfe would vndertake that enterprise, and beginne it when soeuer hee pleased. <hi>Anselmo</hi> imbraced him very tender and louingly, and gratified him as much for that promise, as if he had done him some very great fauour: and there they accorded betweene them, that he should beginne the worke the very next day insuing, for he would giue him place and leasure to speake alone with <hi>Camila,</hi> and would likewise prouide him of money, jewels, and other things to present vnto her. He did also admonish him to bring musicke vnder her windowes by night, and write verses in her praise, and if he would not take the paine to make them, he himselfe would compose them for him. <hi>Lothario</hi> promised to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all himselfe, yet with an intention far wide from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmos;</hi> and with this agreement they returned to <hi>Ansel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> house, where they found <hi>Camila</hi> somewhat sad and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, expecting her husbands returne, who had stayed longer abroade that day then his custome. <hi>Lothario</hi> leauing him at his house, returned to his owne, as pensiue as he had left <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> contented, and knew not what plot to lay, to issue out of that impertinent affaire with prosperous successe. But that night hee bethought himselfe of a manner how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue <hi>Anselmo</hi> without offending <hi>Camila:</hi> and so the next day insuing hee came to his friends house to dinner, where <hi>Camila</hi> knowing the great good will her husband bore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, did receaue and entertaine him very kindly with the like, dinner being ended, and the table taken vp, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> requested <hi>Lothario</hi> to keepe <hi>Camila</hi> company vntil his returne, for hee must haue gone about an affaire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him greatly, but would returne againe within an houre and a halfe. <hi>Camila</hi> intreated her husband to stay, and <hi>Lothario</hi> proferd to goe and keepe him companie, but nothing could preuaile with <hi>Anselmo,</hi> but rather he impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> to remaine and abide there his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, because hee must goe to treate of a matter of much consequence. He also commanded <hi>Camila</hi> not to leaue <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:173111:195"/> alone vntill he came backe. And so hee departed lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Camila</hi> and <hi>Lothario</hi> together at the table, by reason that all the attendants and seruants were gone to dinner.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Lothario</hi> saw that he was entred into the lists, which his friend so much desired, which his aduersarie before him who was with her beautie able to ouercome a whole squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of armed Knights; see then if <hi>Lothario</hi> had not reason to feare himselfe? but that which he did at the first onset was to lay his elbow on the arme of his chaire, and his hand on his cheeke, and desiring <hi>Camila</hi> to beare with his respectles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse therein, he said he would repose a little, whilest hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Anselmo's</hi> comming. <hi>Camila</hi> answered that shee thought hee might take his ease better on the cushions of state, and therefore prayed him hee would enter into the parler and lye on them. But he excused himselfe, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained asleepe in the same place, vntill <hi>Anselmos</hi> returne, who comming in, and finding his wife in her chamber and <hi>Lothario</hi> a sleepe, made full account, that by reason of his long stay, they had time enough both to talke, and repose, and therefore expected very greedily the houre wherein his friend should awake, to goe out with him, and learne what successe he had: all succeeded as he wished, for <hi>Lothario</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, and both of them went abroade, and then he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him what hee desired: and <hi>Lothario</hi> answered that it seemed not to him so good to discouer al his meaning at the first, and therefore had done no other thing at that time, then speake a little of her beautie and discretion, for it seemed to him that this was the best preamble he could vse to gaine by little and litle some interest and possession in her acceptance, to dispose her thereby the better to giue eare againe to his wordes more willingly, imitating therein the Diuels craft when hee meanes to deceaue any one that is vigilant and carefull, for then hee translates himselfe into an Angell of light, being one of darkenesse, and laying before him appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent goods, discouers what hee is in the end, and brings his intention to passe, if his guiles bee not at the beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:173111:195"/> All this did greatly like <hi>Anselmo,</hi> who said that hee would affoorde him euery day as much leasure, although he did not goe abroade, for hee would spend the time so at home, as <hi>Camila</hi> should neuer be able to suspect his drift.</p>
               <p>It therefore befell, that many daies passed, which <hi>Lothario</hi> did willingly ouerslip, and said nothing to <hi>Camila,</hi> yet did he euer soothe <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and told him, that hee had spoken to her, but could neuer winne her to giue the least argument of flexibilitie, or make way for the feeblest hope that might be: but rather affirmed that shee threatned him, that if hee did not repell his impertinent desires, shee would detect his indirect proceedings to her husband. It is well quoth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Camila</hi> hath resisted wordes, it is therefore requisite to trie what resistance she wil make against works. I will giue thee to morrow foure thousand crownes in gold, to the end thou maist offer, and also bestow them on her: and thou shalt haue as many more to buy jewels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to baile her: for women are naturally inclined, and specially if they be faire (be they euer so chast) to goe braue and gorgeously attired, and if shee can ouercome this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I will remaine pleased, and put thee to no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Lothario</hi> answered that seeing he had begun, he would beare his enterprise on to an end, although he made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he should depart from the conflict, both tyred and vanquished. He receaued the foure thousand crownes the next day, and at once with them foure thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, for he knew not what to inuent, to lie a new; but concluded finally to tell to his friend how <hi>Camila</hi> was as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible at gifts and promises as at words, and therefore it would be in vaine to trauaile any more in her pursuite, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he should doe nothing else but spend the time in vaine.</p>
               <p>But fortune which guided these affaires in an other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so disposed, that <hi>Anselmo</hi> hauing left <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Camila</hi> alone as he was wont, entred secretly into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and through the cranies and chinks did listen and see what they would doe: where he perceaued that <hi>Lothario</hi> in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:173111:196"/> the space of halfe an houre spoke not a word to <hi>Camila,</hi> nor yet would he haue spoken though hee had remained there a whole age, and thereupon surmised straight, that all that which his friend had told him of <hi>Camilas</hi> answeres and his owne speech were but fictions and vntruthes, and that hee might the more confirme himselfe, and see whether it were so, he came forth and calling <hi>Lothario</hi> apart, he demaunded of him what <hi>Camila</hi> had said, and in what humour shee was at the present? <hi>Lothario</hi> answered that he meant not euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to sound her in that matter, for shee replied to him so vntowardly and sharply, as he durst not attempt any more to speake vnto her of such things. O, quoth <hi>Anselmo, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario, Lothario,</hi> how euill dost thou answere to the affection thou owest me, or to the confidence I did repose in thee? I haue stood beholding thee all this while through the hole of that locke, and saw how thou neuer spokest one word to her. Whereby I doe also collect, that thou hast not yet once accosted her, and if it be so, as doubtlesly it is, say, why dost thou deceaue me? or why goest thou about fraudulently to depriue me of those meanes, whereby I may obtaine my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires? <hi>Anselmo</hi> said no more, yet what he said was sufficient to make <hi>Lothario</hi> confused and ashamed, who taking it to be a blemish to his reputation to bee found in a lie, swore to <hi>Anselmo,</hi> that he would from thence forward so indeuour to please his minde and tell him no more leasings, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe might perceaue the successe thereof, if he did againe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously lye in watch for him, a thing which hee might well excuse, because his most serious labour to satisfie his desire, should remooue all shadowe of suspicion. <hi>Anselmo</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, and that he might giue him the greater commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and lesse occasion of feare, he resolued to absent himselfe from his house some eight daies, and goe to visit a friend of his, that dwelled in a Village not farre from the Cittie, and therefore dealt with his friend that he should send a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to call for him very earnestly, that vnder that pretext, he might finde an excuse to <hi>Camila</hi> for his departure,</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:173111:196"/>
               <p>O infortunate and inconsiderate <hi>Anselmo,</hi> what is that which thou doest? what doest thou contriue? or what is that thou goest about? behold thou workest thine owne ruine, laying plots of thine owne dishonour, and giuing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thy proper perdition. Thy wife <hi>Camila</hi> is good, thou dost possesse her in quiet and peaceable manner, no man sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth thy delights, her thoughts transgresse not the limits of her house. Thou art her heauen on earth, and the goale to which her desires aspire. Thou art the accomplishment and summe of her delectation, thou art the squire by which shee measureth and directeth her will, adiusting wholy with thine and with that of heauen. Since then the mines of her honour, beautie, modestie, and recollection, bountifully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee without any toile, all the treasures contained in them, or thou canst desire, why wouldest thou digge the earth, and seeke out new vaines, and new seene treasures exposing thy selfe to the danger, that thy labours may turne to wracke, seeing in fine, that they are only sustained by the weake supporters of her fraile nature? remember how hee that seekes the impossible, may iustly bee refused of that which is possible, according vnto that which the Poet saith:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>IN death for life I seeke.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> departed the next day following to the Village, telling <hi>Camila</hi> at his departure, that whilest hee were absent his friend <hi>Lothario</hi> would come and see to the affaires of his
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:173111:197"/> house, and to eate with her, and desired her therefore, to make as much of him, as shee would doe of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Camila</hi> like a discreet and modest woman, was grieued at the order her husband did giue to her, and requested him to render how indecent it was that any one should possesse the chaire of his table, he being absent, and if hee did it, as doubting her insufficiencie, to manage his houshold affaires, that at least he should make triall of her that one time, and should clearely perceaue how shee was able to discharge matters of farre greater consequence. <hi>Anselmo</hi> replyed, that what hee commanded was his pleasure, and therefore shee had nothing else to doe, but hold downe the head, and obay it. <hi>Camila</hi> answered, that shee would doe so, although it was very much against her will. In fine her husband de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and <hi>Lothario</hi> came the next day following to the house, where hee was entertained by <hi>Camila</hi> very friendly, but would neuer treate with <hi>Lothario</hi> alone, but euermore was compassed by her seruant and waiting Maidens, but chiefly by one called <hi>Leonela,</hi> whome shee loued dearely; as one that had beene brought vp with her in her Fathers house, euen from their infancie, and when shee did marry <hi>Anselmo,</hi> shee brought her from thence in her company.</p>
               <p>The first three dayes <hi>Lothario</hi> spoke not a word, although he might, when the tables were taken vp, and that the folke of the house went hastely to dinner, for so <hi>Camila</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and did giue <hi>Leonela</hi> order besides to dine before her selfe, and that shee should still keepe by her side: but the gyrle which had her fancie otherwise imployed in thinges more pleasing her humour, and needed those houres and times for the accomplishing of them, did not alwaies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish so punctually her Ladies command, but now and then would leaue her alone, as if that were her Ladies beheast. But the honest presence of <hi>Camila,</hi> the grauitie of her face, and the modestie of her carriage was such, as it serued as a bridle to restraine <hi>Lotharios</hi> tongue. But the benefit of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milas</hi> many vertues, setting silence to <hi>Lotharios</hi> speech, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:173111:197"/> afterward to both their harmes. For though the tongue spoke not, yet did his thoughts discourse, and had leasure afforded them to contemplate, part by part, all the extremes of worth and beautie that were cumulated in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila</hi> potent to inflame a statue of frozen Marble: how much more an heart of flesh. <hi>Lothario</hi> did only behold her in the time and space he should speake vnto her, and did then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how worthy shee was to be loued. And this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration did by little and little giue assaults to the respects which he ought to haue borne towards his friend <hi>Anselmo:</hi> a thousand times did hee determine to absent himselfe from the Cittie, and goe where <hi>Anselmo</hi> should neuer see him, nor hee <hi>Camila:</hi> but the delight hee tooke in beholding her did againe with-hold and hinder his resolutions. When hee was alone he would condemne himselfe of his mad designe, and tearme himselfe a badde friend and worse <hi>Christian,</hi> hee made discourses and comparisons betweene himselfe and <hi>Anselmo,</hi> all which did finish in this point that <hi>Anselmos</hi> foolhardinesse, and madnesse was greater, then his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie, and that if hee might bee as easily excused before God, for that he meant to doe, as he would be before men, he needed not to feare any punishment should bee inflicted on him for the crime: finally, <hi>Camilas</hi> beautie and worths, assisted by the occasion which the ignorant husband had thrust into his fists, did wholly ruine and ouerthrow <hi>Lothario</hi> his loyaltie, and therefore without regarding any other thing then that to which his pleasure conducted him, about a three dayes after <hi>Anselmos</hi> departure (which time he had spent in a continuall batraile and resistance of his contending thoughts) he beganne to solicite <hi>Camila,</hi> with such trouble of the spirits and so amorous wordes, as shee was strucken almost beside her selfe with wonder, and made him no other answere, but arising from the table, flung away in a furie into her chamber. But yet for all this drines, <hi>Lothario</hi> his hope (which is wont euermore to bee borne at once with loue) was nothing dismayed, but rather accounted the more
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:173111:198"/> of <hi>Camila,</hi> who perceiuing that in <hi>Lothario,</hi> which she neuer durst before to imagine, knew not what she might doe; but it seeming vnto her to be a thing neither secure nor honest, to giue him occasion or leisure to speake vnto him againe, determined to send one vnto her husband <hi>Anselmo</hi> the same very night, as indeed she did, with a letter to recal him home to her house. The subiect of her Letter was this.</p>

                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> receiued the Letter, and by it vnderstood that <hi>Lothario</hi> had begun the enterprize, and that <hi>Camila</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to him according as he had hoped: and maruellous glad at the newes, he answered his wife by word of mouth, that she should not remoue in any wise from her house, for he would returne with all speed. <hi>Camila</hi> was greatly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his answer, which strucke her into a greater perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then she was at the first, being affraid to stay at home, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:173111:198"/> also to goe to her fathers. For by staying she indangers her honesty, by going she should transgresse her husbands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: at last she resolued to doe that which was worst, which was to remaine at home, and not to shunne <hi>Lotharios</hi> presence, lest she should giue her seruants occasion of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and now she was grieued to haue written what shee did to her husband, feareful lest he should thinke that <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> had noted in her some token of lightnesse, which might haue moued him to lose the respect which otherwise was due vnto her: but confident in her innocency, she cast her hopes in God and her good thoughts, wherewithall shee thought to resist all <hi>Lotharios</hi> words, and by holding her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent without making him any answere, without giuing any further account of the matter to her husband, lest thereby she might plunge him in new difficulties &amp; contention with his friend, and did therefore bethinke her how shee might excuse <hi>Lothario</hi> to <hi>Anselmo,</hi> when he should demaund the occasion that moued her to write vnto him that Letter. With these more honest then profitable or discreete resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions she gaue eare the second day to <hi>Lothario,</hi> who charged her with such resolution, as her constancy beganne to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and her honesty had enough to doe, recurring to her eyes to containe them, lest they should giue any demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the amorous compassion which <hi>Lotharios</hi> wordes and teares had stirred in her breast. <hi>Lothario</hi> noted all this, and it inflamed him the more. Finally, he thought that it was requisite the time and leisure which <hi>Anselmoes</hi> absence affoorded him, to lay closer siege to that Fortresse: and so he assaulted her presumptiously with the praises of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for there is nothing which with such facility doth render and raze to the ground the proudly crested Turrets of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens vanity, then the same vanity being dilated on by the tongue of adulation and flattery. To be briefe, he did with all diligence vndermine the rocke of her integrity with so warlike engines, as although <hi>Camila</hi> were made of brasse, yet would she be ouerthrowne. For <hi>Lothario</hi> wept, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:173111:199"/> promised, flattered, persisted and fained so feelingly, and with such tokens of truth, as trauersing <hi>Camilas</hi> care of her honour, he came in the end to triumph ouer that which was least suspected, and he most desired: for she rendred her selfe, euen <hi>Camila</hi> rendred her selfe. But what wonder if <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oes</hi> amitie could not stand on foote? A cleere example, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrating that the amorous passion is onely vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by shunning it; and that no body ought to aduenture to wrestle with so strong an aduersarie: for heauenly forces are necessarie for him that would confront the violence of that passion, although humane. None but <hi>Leonela</hi> knew the weakenesse of her Ladie, for from her the two bad friends and new louers could not conceale the matter: nor yet would <hi>Lothario</hi> discouer to <hi>Camila</hi> her husbands pretence, or that he had giuen him wittingly the oportunity whereby he arriued to that passe, because she should not imagine that he had gotten her lightly, and by chance, and did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely sollicite her.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after <hi>Anselmo</hi> arriued to his house, and did not perceiue what wanted therein, to wit, that which it had lost, and he most esteemed. From thence he went to see his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> whom he found at home, and embracing one another, he demanded of him the newes of his life or of his death. The newes which I can giue thee friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> are, that thou hast a wife who may deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly be the example and garland of all good women. The words that I spoke vnto herwere spent on the ayre, my prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers contemned, and my gifts repulsed, and besides she hath mockt me notably for certaine fained teares that I did shed. In resolution, euen as <hi>Camila</hi> is the patterne of all beauty, so is she a treasury wherein modesty resides, courtesie and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse dwell, and all the other vertues that may beautifie an honourable woman, or make her fortunate. Therefore friend take backe thy money, for here it is ready, and I neuer had occasion to imploy it: for <hi>Camilas</hi> integrity cannot be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with so base things as are gifts and promises. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:173111:199"/> content thy selfe now with the proofes made already, without attempting to make any farther triall. And seeing thou hast past ouer the Sea of difficulties and suspitions with a drie foote, which may and are wont to be had of women: doe not eftsoones enter into the profound depthes of new inconueniences, nor take thou any other Pilot to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the goodnesse and strength of the vessell that heauen hath allotted to thee, to passe therein through the Seas of this world: but make account that thou art harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a safe hauen, and there hold thy selfe fast with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors of good consideration, and so rest thee vntill death come to demaund his debt, from the payment whereof no Nobility or priuiledge whatsoeuer can exempt vs. <hi>Anselmo</hi> rested singularly satisfied at <hi>Lotharios</hi> discourse, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it as firmely as if it were deliuered by an Oracle; but did intreat him notwithstanding to prosecute his attempt, although it were onely done for curiositie, and to passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time; yet not to vse so efficacious meanes, as he thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto practised: and that he only desired him to write some verses in her praise, vnder the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> for hee would make <hi>Camila</hi> beleeue, how that he was inamoured of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lady, to whom he did appropriate that name, that hee might celebrate her prayses with the respect due to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and that if he would not take the paynes to inuent them, that he himselfe would willingly compose them. That is not needfull, quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> for the <hi>Muses</hi> are not so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from me, but that they visite mee sometimes in the yeare. Tell you vnto <hi>Camila</hi> what you haue deuised of my loues: and as for the verses, I will make them my selfe, if not so well as the subiect deserues, yet at the least as artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as I may deuise them. <hi>The impertinent curious man</hi> and his treacherous friend hauing thus agreed, and <hi>Anselmo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his house, he demaunded of <hi>Camila</hi> that which she maruelled he had not asked before, that she should tell vnto him the occasion why she sent vnto him the Letter? <hi>Camila</hi> made answere, because it seemed vnto her, that <hi>Lothario</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:173111:200"/> her somewhat more immodestly then when he was at home; but that now she did againe disswade her selfe, and beleeued that it was but a light surmise, without any ground, because that she perceiued <hi>Lothario</hi> to loath her presence, or be by any meanes alone with her. <hi>Anselmo</hi> tolde her that she might very well liue secure for him, for that he knew <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios</hi> affections were bestowed else-where, and that vpon one of the noblest damzels of the Citie, whose prayses he solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized vnder the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> and that although he were not, yet was there no cause to doubt of <hi>Lotharios</hi> vertue or the amitie that was betweene them both. Here if <hi>Camila</hi> had not beene premonished by <hi>Lothario</hi> that the loue of <hi>Clori</hi> was but fained, and that he himselfe had told it to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> to blinde him, that he might with lesse difficultie cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate her owne prayses vnder the name of <hi>Clori,</hi> shee had without doubt falne into the desperate toyles of iealousie; but being already aduertised, she posted ouer that assault lightly. The day following they three sitting together at dinner, <hi>Anselmo</hi> requested <hi>Lothario</hi> to repeate some one of the verses that he had made to his beloued <hi>Clori;</hi> for seeing that <hi>Camila</hi> knew her not, he might boldly say what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Although she knew her, quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> yet would I not therefore suppresse any part of her praises. For when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny louer praiseth his Ladie for her beauty, and doth withall taxe her of cruelty, her credit incurres no danger. But befall what it list, I composed yesterday a Sonnet of the ingratitude of <hi>Clori,</hi> and is this ensuing.</p>

                  <hi>Camila</hi> liked the Sonnet very well, but <hi>Anselmo</hi> best of all; for he praysed it, and said, that the Lady must be very cruell, that would not answere such perspicuous truths, with reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall affection.

                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> commended also this second Sonnet as hee had done the first, and added by that means one linke to another in the chaine, wherewith he intangled himselfe, and forged his owne dishonour: seeing when <hi>Lothario</hi> dishonoured him most of all, he said vnto him then that he honoured him most. And herewith all <hi>Camila</hi> made all the linkes that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serued onely to abase her downe to the Center of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, seeme to mount her in her husbands opinion, vp to the height of vertue and good fame.</p>
               <p>It befell soone after, that <hi>Camila</hi> finding her selfe alone with her mayden said to her, I am ashamed friend <hi>Leonela</hi> to see how little I knew to value my selfe, seeing that I made not <hi>Lothario</hi> spend some time at least in the purchasing the whole possession of mee, which I with a prompt will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon him so speedily. I feare me that he will impute my hastinesse to lightnesse, without cōsidering the force he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards mee, which wholy hindred and disabled my resistance. Let not that afflict you Madam quoth <hi>Leonela,</hi> for it is no sufficient cause to diminish estimation, that, that bee giuen quickly which is to be giuen, if that in effect be good that is giuen, and be in it selfe worthy of estimation; for it is an old prouerbe, <hi>That hee that giues quickly, giues twice.</hi> It is also said as well quoth <hi>Camila, that that which costeth little, is lesse esteemed.</hi> That reason hath no place in you quoth <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela,</hi> for as much as loue according as some say, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, doth sometimes flie, other times it goes, it runs with this man, and goes leasurely with the other; it makes some key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold, and inflames others, some it wounds, and some it kils, it begins the Carrire of his desires in an instant, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:173111:201"/> same, concludes it likewise: It is wont to lay siege to the fortresse in the morning, and at night it makes it to yeelde; for ther's no force able to resist it: which being so, what doe you wonder, or what is it that you feare? If the same hath befalne <hi>Lothario,</hi> seeing that loue made of my Lords absence an instrument to vanquish vs? and it was forcible, that in it we should conclude on it which loue had before determined, without giuing time it selfe any time, to leade <hi>Anselmo</hi> that he might returne, and with his presence leaue the worke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. For loue hath none so officious or better a minister to execute his desires then is occasion: It serues it selfe of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion in all his act, but most of all at the beginning. And all this that I haue said, I know rather by experience then heare say: as I will some day let you to vnderstand, for Madam I am likewise made of flesh, and lustie young bloud. And as for you Ladie <hi>Camila,</hi> you did not giue vp and yeelde your selfe presently, but stayed vntill you had first seene in <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios</hi> eyes, his sighes in his discourses, in his promises and gifts all his soule, in which and in his perfections you might reade how worthy he is to be loued. And seeing this is so, let not these scruples &amp; nice thoughts assault or further disturbe your mind, but perswade your selfe that <hi>Lothario</hi> esteemes you as much as you doe him, and liues with content &amp; satisfaction, seeing that it was your fortune to fal into the amorous snare, that it was his good lucke to catch you with his valour and deserts: who not only hath the foure. <hi>S S.</hi> which they say eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good louer oughtto haue, but also the whole A. B. C. which if you will not credite, doe but listen to me a while, and I will repeate it to you by roate. He is as it seemes, and as farre as can iudge amiable, bountifull, courteous, dutifull, enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, firme, gallant, honourable, illustrious, loyall, milde, noble, honest, prudent, quiet, rich, and the S. S. which they say, and besides true, valorous. The X. doth not quader well with him, because it sounds harshly: Y. he is young. And the Z. he is zealous of thine honour. <hi>Camila</hi> laughed at her maydens A. B. C. and accounted her to bee more practicke
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:173111:202"/> in loue matters then she her selfe had confessed, as indeed she was, for then she reuealed to her Mistresse, how she and a certaine young man well borne of the Citie did treate of loue one with another: Hereat her Mistresse was not a little troubled in minde, fearing that her honour might be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indangered by that meanes; she demaunded whether her affections had passed farther then words, and the maid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered very shamelesly and freely that they did: for it is most certaine that this kinde of wretchlesse Mistresses doe also make their maydens carelesse and impudent: who when they perceiue their Ladies to faulter, are commonly wont to hault likewise themselues, and care not that the world doe know it. <hi>Camila</hi> seeing this errour past remedie, could do no more but intreate <hi>Leonela</hi> not to reueale any thing of her affaires, to him she said was her sweet heart; &amp; that she should handle her matters discreetly &amp; secretly, lest they might come to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> or <hi>Lotharios</hi> notice. <hi>Leonela</hi> promised to performe her wil, but did accōplish her promise in such sort, as she did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>Camilas</hi> feares, that she should lose her credit by her means. For the dishonest &amp; bold Gyrle after that she had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that her Mistres, her proceedings were not such as they were wont, grew so hardy as she gaue entrance, and brought her louer into her Maisters house, presuming that although her Ladie knew it, yet would she not dare to discouer it. For this among other harmes follow the sinnes of Mistresses, that it makes them slaues to their owne seruants, and doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to conceale their dishonest and base proceedings as it fell out in <hi>Camila,</hi> who although she espied <hi>Leonela</hi> not once onely, but sundry times together with her louer in a certaine chamber of the house, she not onely dared not to rebuke her for it, but rather gaue her oportunity to hide him, and would remoue all occasions out of her husbands way, whereby he might suspect any such thing.</p>
               <p>But all could not hinder <hi>Lothario</hi> from espying him once, as he departed out of the house at the breake of the day: who not knowing him, thought at the first that it was a spirit, but
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:173111:202"/> when he saw him post away, and cast his cloake ouer his race, least he should be known, he abandoning his simple surmise, fell into a new suspiciō which had ouerthrown them all, were it not that <hi>Camila</hi> did remedie it. For <hi>Lothario</hi> thought that he whom he had seene issue out of <hi>Anselmos</hi> house at so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable an hower, had not entred into it for <hi>Leonelas</hi> sake, nor did he remember then that there was such a one as <hi>Leonela</hi> in the world, but onely thought that as <hi>Camila</hi> was lightly gotten by him, so belike she was won by some other. For the wickednesse of a bad woman bringeth vsually all these additions, that she looseth her reputatiō euen with him to whom prayed and perswaded she yeeldeth her selfe: and he beleeueth that she will as easily, or with more facility consent to others, and doth infallibly credit the least suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion which thereof may be offered.</p>
               <p>And it seemes that <hi>Lothario</hi> in this instant was wholy depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all reasonable discourse, and quite dispoyled of his vnderstanding, for without pondering of the matter, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; kindled by the iealouse rage that inwardly gnawed his bowels, fretting with desire to be reuenged on <hi>Camila,</hi> who had neuer offended him, he came to <hi>Anselmo</hi> before he was vp, &amp; said to him: know <hi>Anselmo</hi> that I haue had these many daies a ciuill conflict within my selfe whether I should speake or no, and I haue vsed as much violence as I might, to my selfe, not to discouer a thing vnto you, which now it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iust nor reasonable I should conceale. Know that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milas</hi> fortresse is rendred and subiect to all that I please to commaund, and if I haue beene somewhat slow to informe thee this of truth, it was because I would first see, whether it proceeded of some light appetite in her: or whether shee did it to trie me, and see whether that loue was still constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, which I first began to make vnto her by thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and licence. I did also beleeue, that if shee had beene such as she ought to bee, and her that we both esteemed her, she would haue by this time acquainted you with my impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacy: but seeing that she lingers therein, I presume that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:173111:203"/> her promises made vnto mee are true, that when you did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine absent your selfe out of the towne, she would speake with mee in the wardrobe (and it was true, for there <hi>Camila</hi> was accustomed to talke with him) yet would not I haue thee runne rashly to take reuenge, seeing the sinne is not yet otherwise committed then in thought, &amp; perhaps betweene this and the oportunity she might hope to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her mind would be changed, and she repent her selfe of her folly. And therefore seeing that thou hast euer followed mine aduises partly or wholy, follow and keepe one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile that I will giue vnto thee now, to the ende that thou mayest after with carefull assurance, and without fraud satisfie thine owne will as thou likest best, faine thy selfe to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent two or three daies as thou art wont, and then conuey thy self cunningly into the wardrobe, where thou maist very well hide thy selfe behind the tapestry, and then thou shalt see with thine owne eyes, and I with mine what <hi>Camila</hi> will doe; and if it be that wickednesse which rather ought to be feared then hoped for, thou maiest with wisedome, silence, and discretion bee the proper executioner of so iniurious a wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> remained amazed, and almost besides himselfe, heating his friend <hi>Lothario</hi> so vnexpectedly to acquaint him with those things, in a time wherein he least expected them, for now hee esteemed <hi>Camila</hi> to haue escaped victresse from the forged assaults of <hi>Lothario,</hi> and did himselfe triumph for glorie of her victorie, suspended thus and troubled, he stood silent a great while looking on the earth without once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing his eye from it; and finally turning towards his friend, he said. <hi>Lothario,</hi> thou hast done all that which I could expect from so intire amitie, and I do therefore meane to follow thine aduice in all things precisely, doe therefore what thou pleasest, and keepe that secret which is requisite in so waighty and vnexpected an euent, or that I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise quoth <hi>Lothario,</hi> and so departed wholly repented for that hee had told to <hi>Anselmo</hi> seeing how foolishly hee had
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:173111:203"/> proceeded, since hee might haue reuenged himselfe on <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila</hi> very well, without taking away so cruell and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. There did he curse his little wit; and abased his light resolution: and knewe not what meanes to vse to destroy what he had done, or giue it some reasonable and contrary issue. In the end hee resolued to acquaint <hi>Camila</hi> with the whole matter, and by reason that hee neuer missed of opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to speake vnto her, he found her alone the very same day; and shee seeing likewise that shee had commoditie to speake vnto him, said. Know friend <hi>Lothario</hi> that a certaine thing doth pinch my heart in such manner, as it seemes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burst in my brest, as doubtlesly I feare me that in time it will, if we cannot set a remedie to it. For such is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modestie of <hi>Leonela,</hi> as shee shuts vp a louer of hers euery night in this house, and remaines with him vntill day light, which so much concernes my credit, as it leaues open a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious field to him, that sees the other goe out of my house at so vnseasonable times, to iudge of me what he pleaseth; and that which most grieues mee is that I dare not punish or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke her for it. For shee being priuie to our proceedings sets a bridle on me, and constraines me to conceale hers, and hence I feare me will bad successe befall vs. <hi>Lothario</hi> at the first suspected that <hi>Camila</hi> did speake thus to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the man whom he had espied, was <hi>Leonelas</hi> friend, and none of hers: but seeing her to weepe indeede and bee greatly afflicted in minde, he began at last to giue credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth, and beleeuing it, was greatly confounded and grieued for that he had done. And yet notwithstanding he answered <hi>Camila</hi> that shee should not trouble or vexe her selfe any more, for he would take such order as <hi>Leonelas</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencies should bee easily crost and suppressed. And then did recount vnto her all that hee had said to <hi>Anselmo,</hi> spurd on by the furious rage of iealous indignation, and how her husband had agreed to hide himselfe behinde the tapestrie of the wardrobe, that he might from thence clearly perceiue, the little loyaltie shee kept towards him, and demanded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:173111:204"/> of her for that follie and counsaile to redresse it, &amp; come safely out of the intricate Labyrinth, whereinto his weake eyed discourse had conducted him.</p>

                  <hi>Camila</hi> hauing heard <hi>Lotharios</hi> discourse, was afraid and amazed, and with great anger, and many and discreet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did rebuke him, reuiling the basenesse of his thoughts, and the simple and little consideration that hee had. But as women haue naturally a suddaine wit, for good or bad much more prompt then men: although when indeed they would make discourses, it proues defectiue. So <hi>Camila</hi> found in an instant a remedy for an affaire in apparance so irremediable and helplesse, and therfore bad <hi>Lothario</hi> to induce his friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> to hide himselfe the next day ensuing, for shee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to take commodity out of his being there, for them both to ioy one another with more securitie then euer they had before: and without wholly manifesting her prouerbe to him, shee only aduertised him to haue care, that after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo</hi> were hidden hee should presently come when <hi>Leonela</hi> called for him, and that he should answere her as directly to euery question shee proposed, as if <hi>Anselmo</hi> were not in place. <hi>Lothario</hi> did vrge her importunately to declare her designe vnto him, to the end he might with more securitie and aduice obserue all that was necessarie. I say, quoth <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila,</hi> there is no other obseruance to bee had, then onely to answere me directly to what I shall demaund. For she would not giue him account before hand of her determination, fearefull that he would not conforme himselfe to her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which shee tooke to bee so good; or else least he would follow or seeke any other, that would not proue after so well. Thus departed <hi>Lothario,</hi> and <hi>Anselmo</hi> vnder pretext that hee would visit his friend out of Towne departed, and returned couertly backe againe to hide himselfe, which hee could do the more commodiously, because <hi>Camila</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nela</hi> did purposely afford him oportunitie, <hi>Anselmo</hi> hauing hidden himselfe, with the griefe that may bee imagined one would conceiue, who did expect to see with his owne eyes
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:173111:204"/> an anotomie made of the bowels of his honour, and was in danger to loose the highest felicitie that hee accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to possesse in his beloued <hi>Camila: Camila</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi> being certaine that he was hidden within the wardrobe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, wherein scarce had <hi>Camila</hi> set her foote, when breathing forth of a deepe sigh shee spoke in this manner.</p>
               <p>Ah friend <hi>Leonela</hi> were it not better, that before I put in execution, that which I would not haue thee to know, least thou shouldest indeauour to hinder it, that thou takest <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmos</hi> poyniard that I haue sought of thee, and passe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous brest of mine through and through? but doe it not, for it is no reason that I should suffer for other mens faults. I will know first of all what the bold and dishonest eyes of <hi>Lothario</hi> noted in me that should stirre in him the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to discouer vnto me so vnlawfull a desire, as that which he hath reuealed, so much in contempt of his friend, and to my dishonour. Stand at that window <hi>Leonela,</hi> and call him to mee, for I doe infallibly beleeue, that hee stands in the streete awaiting to effect his wicked purpose. But first my cruell, yet honourable minde shall be first performed. Alas deare Madame (quoth the wise and craftie <hi>Leonela)</hi> what is is it you meane to doe with that poyniard? meane you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to depriue either your owne or <hi>Lotharios</hi> life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall? for which soeuer of these things you doe, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the losse of your credit and fame. It is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that you dissmble your wrong, and giue no occasion to the bad man now to enter into this house, and finde vs here in it alone: Consider good Madame how we are but weake women, and hee is a man, and one resolute, and by reason that he comes blinded by his bad and passionate intent, hee may peraduenture before thou beest able to put thine in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, doe somewhat that would be worse for you, then to depriue you of your life. Euill befall my M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Anselmo,</hi> that ministers so great occasion to impudencie, thus to discouer her visage in our house, and if you should kill him by chance Madame, as I suspect you meane to doe, what shall we doe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:173111:205"/> after with the dead carkasse? what? said <hi>Camila,</hi> we would leaue him here that <hi>Anselmo</hi> might burie him. For he must in all equitie esteeme that labour for ease, which hee shall passe, in the interring of his owne infamie. Make an end then, and call him, for mee thinkes that all the time which I spend vntaking due reuenge of my iust disdaine, turnes into the preiudice of the loyaltie which I owe to my spouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> listned very attentiuely all the while, and at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that <hi>Camila</hi> said, his thoughts changed. But when he vnderstood that shee was resolued to kill <hi>Lothario,</hi> he was about to come out and discouer himselfe, to the end that such a thing should not be done, but the desire that hee had to see wherein so braue and honest a resolution would end with-held him, determining then to sallie out, when his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence should be needfull to hinder it. <hi>Camila</hi> about this time beganne to bee very weake and dismayed, and casting her selfe, as if shee had fallen into a trance vpon a bed that was in the roome, <hi>Leonela</hi> beganne to lament very bitterly and to say. Alas wretch that I am, how vnfortunate should I be, if the flower of the worlds honestie, the crowne of good women, and the patterne of chastitie, should die here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene my hands. Those and such other things shee said so dolefully, as no one could heare her, that would not deeme her to bee one of the most esteemed and loyall Damzels of the world: and take her Ladie for an other new and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Penelope.</hi> Soone after <hi>Camila</hi> returned to her selfe, and said presently. Why goest thou not <hi>Leonela</hi> to call the most disloyall friend of a friend, that euer the Sunne beheld, or the night concealed. Make an end, runne, make hast, and let not the fire of my choller bee through thy stay consumed and spent, nor the iust reuenge which I hope to take passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in threats or maledictions. I goe to call him Madame, quoth <hi>Leonela,</hi> but first of all you must giue mee that poyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, least you should doe with it in mine absence somewhat that would minister occasions to vs your friends to deplore you all the dayes of our liues. Goe away boldly friend
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:173111:205"/>
                  <hi>Leonela</hi> said <hi>Camila,</hi> for I shall do nothing in thine absence; for although I be in thine opinion both simple and bolde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to turne for mine honour, yet meane I not to be so much as the celebrated <hi>Lucretia,</hi> of whom it is recorded that she slew her selfe, without hauing committed any error or slaine him first who was the principall cause of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: I will die if I must needes die, but I will be satisfied and reuenged on him that hath giuen me occasion to come into this place to lament his boldnesse, sprung without my default. <hi>Leonela</hi> could scarcely be intreated to goe and call <hi>Lothario;</hi> but at last she went out, and in the meane time <hi>Camila</hi> remained, speaking to her selfe these words: Good God, had not it beene more discretion to haue dismissed <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario,</hi> as I did many times before, then thus to possesse him as I haue done, with an opinion that I am an euill and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest woman, at least all the while that passeth, vntill mine actes shall vndeceiue him, and teach him the contrary? It had beene doubtlesly better: but then should not I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, nor mine husbands honour satisfied. If he were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to beare away so cleerely his malignitie, or escape out of the snare wherein his wicked thoughts inuolued him. Let the Traytor pay with his lifes defrayment, that which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with so lasciuious a desire. Let the world know (if it by chance shall come to know it) that <hi>Camila</hi> did not only conserue the loyaltie due to her Lord, but also took reuenge of the intended spoile thereof. But yet I beleeue that it were best to giue <hi>Anselmo</hi> first notice thereof; but I did already touch it to him in the Letter which I wrote to him to the Village: and I beleeue that his not concurring to take order in this so manifest an abuse, proceeds of his too sincere and good meaning, which would not, nor cannot beleeue, that the like kinde of thought, could euer finde intertainment in the breast of so firme a friend, tending so much to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and what maruell, if I my selfe could not credite it for a great many daies together, nor would I euer haue thought it, if his insolency had not arriued to that passe, which the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:173111:206"/> manifest gifts, large promises, and continuall teares hee shed doe giue testimony. But why doe I make now these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses? Hath a gallant resolution perhaps any neede of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? No verily; therefore auaunt treacherous thoughts, here we must vse reuenge. Let the false man come in, arriue, die and end, and let after befall what can befall. I entred pure and vntouched to his possession, whom heauen bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me for mine, and I will depart from him purely: and if the worst befall, I shall onely be defiled by mine owne chaste bloud, and the impute goare of the falsest friend that euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie saw in this world. And saying of this she praunced vp and down the roome with the poyniard naked in her hand, with such long and vnmeasurable strides, and making withal such gestures, as she rather seemed defectiue of wit, and a desperate ruffian, then a delicate woman.</p>
               <p>All this <hi>Anselmo</hi> perceiued very well from behinde the Arras that couerd him; which did not a little admire him, and he thought that what he had seene and heard, was a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient satisfaction of farre greater suspitions then he had: and could haue wished with all his heart that the trial of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharios</hi> comming might be excused, fearing greatly some sudden badde successe: and as he was ready to manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and to come out and embrace and disswade his wife; he withdrew himselfe because he saw <hi>Leonela</hi> returne, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lothario</hi> in by the hand, and as soone as <hi>Camila</hi> beheld him, she drew a great strike with the point of the poyniard athwart the wardrop, saying <hi>Lothario,</hi> note wel what I mean to say vnto thee: for if by chance thou beest so hardy as to passe ouer this iine which thou seest, ere I come as far as it, I will in the very same instant stabbe my selfe into the heart with this poyniard, which I hold in my hand: and before thou doest speake or answer me any word I would first haue thee to listen to a few of mine, for after thou maiest say what thou pleasest. First of all I would haue thee, O <hi>Lothario,</hi> to say whether thou knowest my husband <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and what opinion thou hast of him? And next I would haue thee to tel
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:173111:206"/> me if thou knowest my selfe? Answer to this without delay, nor do not stand long thinking on what thou art to answer, seeing they are no deepe questions which I propose vnto thee. <hi>Lothario</hi> was not so ignorant, but that from the very beginning when <hi>Camila</hi> requested him to perswade her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to hide himselfe behinde the tapistry, he had not falne on the drift of her inuention, and therefore did answere her intention so aptly and discreetly, as they made that vntruth passe betweene them for a more then manifest verity: and so he answered to <hi>Camila</hi> in this forme, I did neuer coniecture beautifull <hi>Camila,</hi> that thou wouldest haue called me here to demaund of me things so wide from the purpose for which I come: if thou doest it to deserre yet the promised fauour, thou mightest haue intertained it yet farther off; for the good desired afflicteth so much the more, by how much the hope to possesse it is neere. But because thou mayest not accuse me for not answering to thy demaunds, I say that I know thy husband <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and both of vs know one another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from our tender infancie, and I will not omit to say that, which thou also knowest of our amity, to make me thereby a witnesse against my selfe of the wrong which loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels me to doe vnto him, yet loue is a sufficient excuse and excuser of greater errors then are mine. Thee doe I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise know and hold in the same possession that he doth: for were it not so, I should neuer haue beene won by lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections then thine, to transgresse so much that which I owe to my selfe, and to the holy lawes of true amitie, now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and violated by the tyrannie of so powerfull an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary as loue hath proued. If thou dost acknowledge that replied <hi>Camila,</hi> O mortall enemy of all that which iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth loue, with what face darest thou then appeare before that which thou knowest to be the mirror wherin he lookes, in whom thou also oughtest to behold thy selfe, to the end thou mightest perceiue vpon how little occasion thou dost wrong him? but vnfortunate that I am, I fall now in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which hath moued thee to make so little account of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:173111:207"/> thine owne duety, which was perhaps some negligent or light behauiour of mine, which I will not call dishonesty, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as I presume, it hath not proceeded from me delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, but rather through the carelesnes that women which thinke they are not noted do sometimes vnwittingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. If not, say traytor, when did I euer answere thy prayers with any word or token, that might awake in thee the least shadow of hope to accomplish thine infamous desires? When were not thine amorous intreaties reprehended and dispersed by the roughnesse and rigour of mine answers? When were thy many promises and larger gifts euer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or admitted? But for as much as I am perswaded that no man can perseuere long time in the amorous cōtention, who hath not beene sustayned by some hope, I will attribute the fault of thine impertinence to my selfe: for doubtlesly some carelesnesse of mine hath hitherto sustained thy care, and therefore I will chastise and giue to my selfe the punishment which thy fault deserueth. And because thou mightest see that I being so inhumane towards my selfe, could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be other then cruell to thee, I thought fit to call thee to be a witnesse of the sacrifice which I meane to make to the offended honor of my most honourable husband, tainted by thee, with the blackest note that thy malice could deuise, and by me through the negligence that I vsed, to shun the occasion, if I gaue thee any, thus to nourish and canonize thy wicked intentions. I say againe that the suspition I haue that my little regard hath ingendred in thee these distracted thoughts, is that which afflicteth me most, and that which I meane to chastice most with mine owne hands: for if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther executioner punished me, then should my crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more notorious; but before I doe this, I dying will kill, and carie him away with me that shall end and satisfie the greedy desire of reuenge which I hope for, and I haue; seeing before mine eyes wheresoeuer I shall go, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which disingaged iustice shall inflict, it still remayning vnbowed or suborned by him, which hath brought me to so desperate termes.</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:173111:207"/>
               <p>And hauing said these wordes, she flew vpon <hi>Lothario</hi> with incredible force and lightnesse, and her poyniard na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, giuing such arguments and tokens that shee meant to stabbe him, as he himselfe was in doubt whether her demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations were false or true; wherefore he was driuen to helpe himselfe by his wit and strength for to hinder <hi>Camila</hi> from striking of him, who did so liuely acte her strange guile and fiction, as to giue it colour, she would giue it a blush of her owne blood: for perceiuing, or else fayning that shee could not hurt <hi>Lothario,</hi> she said seeing that aduerse fortune will not satisfie throughly my iust desires, yet at least it shall not be potent wholly to crosse my designes, and then striuing to free the dagger hand, which <hi>Lothario</hi> held fast, she snatched it away, and directing the point to some place of her bodie, which might hurt her but not very grieuously, she stabd her selfe, and hid it in her apparrell neere vnto the left shoulder, and fell forthwith to the ground, as if she were in a traunce. <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Leonela</hi> stood amazed at the vnexpected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and still rested doubtfull of the truth of the matter, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Camila</hi> to lie on the ground bathed in her bloud: <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario</hi> ranne all wan and pale very hastily to her to take out the poyniard, and seeing how little bloud followed, he lost the feare that he had conceiued of her greater hurt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new to admire the cunning wit, and discretion of the beautifull <hi>Camila:</hi> but yet that he might play the part of a friend, he began a long and dolefull lamentation ouer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milas</hi> bodie, euen as she were dead, &amp; began to breath forth many curses and execrations not onely against himselfe, but also against him that had imployed him in that vnfortunate affaire. And knowing that his friend <hi>Anselmo</hi> did listen vnto him, he said such things as would moue a man to take more compassion of him then of <hi>Camila</hi> her selfe, although they accounted her dead. <hi>Leonela</hi> tooke her vp betweene her armes, and laid her on the bedde, and intreated <hi>Lothario</hi> to goe out, and finde some one that would vndertake to cure her secretly. She also demaunded of him his aduice, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:173111:208"/> the excuse they might make to <hi>Anselmo</hi> concerning her Mistresse her wound, if hee came to towne before it were fully cured. He answered that they might say what they pleased, for hee was not in an humour of giuing any counsell worth the following: And onely sayd this, that shee should labour to staunch her Ladies bloud, for hee meant to goe there, whence they should heare no newes of him euer after: And so departed out of the house with verie greate tokens of griefe and feeling, and when hee was alone in place where no bodie perceiued him, hee blist himselfe a thousand times, to thinke of <hi>Camilas</hi> Art, and the gestures so proper and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the purpose, vsed by her mayde <hi>Leonela.</hi> Hee considered how assured <hi>Anselmo</hi> would remayne, that hee had a second <hi>Portia</hi> to wife, and desired to meete him, that they might celebratte together the fiction, and the best dissembled truth that could bee euer ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. <hi>Leonela</hi> as is said, staunched her Ladies bloud, which was iust as much as might serue to colour her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and no more, and washing the wound with some wine, shee tyed it vp the best that shee could, saying such words whilest she cured her, as were able, though nothing had beene done before to make <hi>Anselmo</hi> beleeue that hee had an Image of honesty in <hi>Camila</hi> to the plants of <hi>Leonela, Camila</hi> added others terming her selfe a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of base spirit, since she wanted time, (being a thing so necessary) to depriue her life which she hated so mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, she demaunded counsell of her maiden whether shee would tell, or conceale all that successe to her beloued spouse: and she answered that it was best to conceale it, lest she should ingage her husband to be reuenged on <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> which could not be done without his very great peril, and that euery good wise was bound not to giue occasion to her husband of quarrelling, but rather to remoue from him as many as was possible. <hi>Camila</hi> answered, that she allowed of her opinion, and would follow it. And that in any sort they
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:173111:208"/> must studie some deuice to cloake the occasion of her hurt from <hi>Anselmo,</hi> who could not chuse but espie it. To this <hi>Leonela</hi> answered that she her selfe knew not how to lie, no not in very iest it selfe. Well friend quoth <hi>Camila,</hi> and I, what do I know? for I dare not to forge, or report an vntruth, if my life lay on it. And if wee knew not how to giue it a better issue, it will be better to report the naked truth, then to be ouertaken in a leesing: doe not trouble your selfe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame quoth <hi>Leonela,</hi> for I will bethinke my selfe of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what betweene this and to morrow morning, and perhaps the wound may be concealed from him, by reason that it is in the place where it is, and heauen perhaps may be pleased to fauour our so iustand honourable thoughts: Be quiet good Madam, and labour to appease your alteration of mind, that my Lord at his returne may not find you perplexed, and leaue all the rest to Gods and my charge, who doth alwaies assist the iust.</p>
               <p>With highest attention stood <hi>Anselmo</hi> listening and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the tragedie of his dying honours, which the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages thereof had acted with so strange and forceable effects as it verily seemed, that they were transformed into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite truth of their well contriued fiction, he longed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the night, and leasure to get out of his house, that hee might goe and congratulate with his good friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> for the precious Iewell that he had found in this last triall of his wife. The Master and Mayden had as great care to giue him the oportunitie to depart, and he fearing to loose it, is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out in a trice, and went presently to finde <hi>Lothario,</hi> who being found, it is not possible to recount the embracements he gaue vnto him, the secrets of his contentment that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, or attributes and praises he gaue to <hi>Camila.</hi> All which <hi>Lothario</hi> heard, without giuing the least argument of loue: hauing represented to his minde at that very time, how greatly deceiued his friend liued, and how iniustly hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had iniuried him. And although that <hi>Anselmo</hi> noted that <hi>Lothario</hi> tooke no delight at his relation, yet did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:173111:209"/> that the cause of his sorrow proceeded from hauing left <hi>Camila</hi> wounded, and he himselfe giuen the occasion thereof. And therefore among many other words said vnto him, that there was no occasion to grieue at <hi>Camilas</hi> hurt, it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly being but light; seeing she and her mayde had agreed to hide it from him; and that according vnto this there was no great cause of feare, but that from thence forward he should liue merily and contentedly with him, seeing that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie and meanes, hee found himselfe raised to the highest felicitie that might be desired: and therefore would from thenceforth spend his idle times in writing of verses in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milas</hi> praise, that he might eternize her name, and make it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in insuing ages. <hi>Lothario</hi> commended his resolution therein, and said that he for his part would also helpe to raise vp so noble an edifice, and herewithall <hi>Anselmo</hi> rested the most soothingly and contentedly deceiued, that could bee found in the world: and then himselfe tooke by the hand to his house (beleeuing that he bore the instrument of his glory) the vtter perdition of his fame. <hi>Camila</hi> entertained him with a frowning countenance, but a cheerefull minde, the fraude rested vnknowne a while, vntill at the end of certaine monethes fortune turned the wheele, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse that was so artificially cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, issued to the publike notice of the world, and <hi>Anselmo</hi> his impertinent curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cost him his life:</p>

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:173111:210"/> at his beds head, and the shedde wine must needes bee that which seemes bloud to this good man, and saying so, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the roome, and all the rest followed him, where they found <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in the strangest guise that may bee imagined: hee was in his shirt, the which was not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before to couer his thighes, and it was sixe fingers shorter behinde: his legges were very long and leane, full of haire and horrible dirtie. Hee wore on his head a little red very greafie night cap, which belonged to the Inkeeper, he had wreathed on his left arme the couerlet of his bedde, on which <hi>Sancho</hi> looked very often and angerly, as one that knew well the cause of his owne malice to it, and in his right hand he griped his naked sword, wherewithall he laid round about him many a thwacke and withall spake, as if he were in battaile with some Giant: and the best sport of all was that he held not his eyes open, for he was indeede a sleepe, and dreaming that he was in fight with the Giant. For the imagination of the aduenture which hee had vndertaken to finish, was so bent vpon it, as it made him to dreame that he was already arriued at the Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> and that he was then in combate with his enemie: and hee had giuen so many blowes on the wine bagges, supposing them to be the Giant, as all the whole chamber flowed with wine. Which being perceiued by the Host all inflamed with rage, he set vpon <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with drie fists, and gaue vnto him so many blowes, that if <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him away, he would doubtlesly haue finished the warre of the Giant, and yet with al this did not the poore knight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake vntill the Barber brought in a great Kettle full of cold water from the Well, and threw it all at a clap vpon him, and therewithall <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> awaked but not in such sort, as he perceiued the manner wherein he was. <hi>Dorotea</hi> seeing how short and how thin her Champion was arrayed, would not go in to see the conflict of her combattant &amp; his aduersarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> went vp and downe the floure searching for the Giants head, and seeing that he could not finde it, hee said,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:173111:210"/> now doe I see very well that all the things of this house are inchantments, for the last time that I was here in this very same roome, I got many blowes and buffets, and knew not who did strike me, nor could I see any body: and now the head appeares not which I saw cut off with mine owne eyes, and yet the bloud ranne as swiftly from the body as water would from a fountaine. What bloud or what fountaine dost thou tattle of here, thou enemie of God and his Saints, quoth the Inkeeper? thou theefe, dost not thou see that the bloud and the fountaine is no other thing, then these wine bagges which are slashed here, and the wine redde that swimmes vp and downe this chamber, and I wish that I may see his soule swimming in hell which did bore them? I know nothing replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> but this that if I cannot finde the Giants head, I shall become so vnfortunate, as mine Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will dissolue like salt cast into water. And certes, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> awake, was in worse case then his Master sleeping, so much had his Lords promises distracted him. The Inkeeper on the other side was at his wits end to see the humour of the Squire, and vnhappinesse of his Lord, and swore that it should not succeed with them now as it had done the other time, when they went away without payment: and that now the priuiledges of Chiualrie should not auaile him, but hee should pay both the one and other, yea euen for the very patches that were to be set on the boared wine bagges.</p>
               <p>The Curate held fast <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> by the hands, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that he had atchieued the aduenture, and was after it come into the Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> her presence, he laid himselfe on his knees before the Curate, saying: Well may your greatnesse, high, and famous Ladie, liue from hence forth secure from any danger, that this vnfortunate wretch may doe vnto you; and I am also freed from this day forward from the promise that I made vnto you, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue by the assistance of the heauens, and through her fauour by whom I liue and breathe, so happely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished it. Did not I say so, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> hearing of his
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:173111:211"/> Master? yea, I was not drunke, see, if my Master hath not powdred the Giant by this? the matter is questionlesse, and the Earledome is mine owne, who would not laugh at these rauing fits of the Master and Man? all of them laughed saue the Inkeeper who gaue himselfe for anger to the Diuel more then a hundred times. And the Barber <hi>Cardenio</hi> and the Curate got <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to bed againe not without much adoe, who presently fell asleepe with tokens of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous wearinesse. They left him sleeping and went out to comfort <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> for the griefe hee had, because hee could not finde the Giants head: but yet had more adoe to pacifie the Inkeeper, who was almost out of his wits for the vnexpected and suddaine death of his wine bagges.</p>
               <p>The Hostesse on the other side went vp and downe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and saying, in an ill season and an vnlucky houre did this Knight errant enter into my house; Alas, and I would that mine eyes had neuer seene him, seeing hee costs mee so deere. The last time that hee was heere, hee went away scot-free for his supper, bedde, straw, and barley, both for himselfe &amp; his man, his horse, and his Asse, saying, that he was a knight aduenturous (and God giue to him ill venture, and to all the other aduenturers of the world) and was not therefore bound to pay any thing, for so it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the statutes of Chiualry. And now for his cause came the other Gentleman, and tooke away my good taile, and hath returnd it me backe, with two quarters of damage. For all the haire is falne off, and it cannot stand my husband any more in steed for the purpose he had it; and for an end and conclusion of all to breake my wine bagges and shedde my wine: I wish I may see as much of his bloud shedde. And do not think otherwise, for by my fathers old bones, and the life of my mother, they shall pay me euery do it, one quart on an other, or else I will neuer be called as I am, nor be mine own fathers daughter. These and such like wordes spake the In-keepers wife with very great fury, and was seconded by her good seruant <hi>Maritornes.</hi> The daughter held her peace, and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:173111:211"/> would now and then smile a little: but Master Parson did quiet and pacifie all, by promising to satisfie them for the damages as well as he might, as well for the wine as for the bagges, but chiefly for her taile, the which was so much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, and valued so highly. <hi>Dorotea</hi> did comfort <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> saying to him, that whensoeuer it should be verified that his Lord had slaine the Giant, and established her quietly in her kingdome, she would bestow vpon him the best Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thereof. With this he tooke courage, and assured the Princesse that he himselfe had seene the Giants head cut off, and for a more certaine token thereof, he said that hee had a beard that reached him downe to his gyrdle; and that if the head could not now be found, it was by reason that all the affaires of that house were guided by inchantment, as he had made experience to his cost the last time that he was lodged therein. <hi>Dorotea</hi> replyed that she was of the same opinion, and bad him to be of good cheere, for all would be well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his hearts desire. All parties being quieted, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate resolued to finish the end of his nouell, because he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that there rested but a little vnread thereof. <hi>Cardenio, Dorotea,</hi> and all the rest intreated him earnestly to finish it. And he desiring to delight them all herein, and recreate himselfe, did prosecute the tale in this manner.</p>
               <p>It after befell that <hi>Anselmo</hi> grew so satisfied of his wiues honestie, as he led a most contented and secure life: and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila</hi> did for the nonce looke sourely vpon <hi>Lothario</hi> to the end <hi>Anselmo</hi> might conster her mind amisse: and for a greater confirmation thereof, <hi>Lothario</hi> requested <hi>Anselmo</hi> to excuse his comming any more to his house, seeing that hee cleerely perceiued how <hi>Camila</hi> could neither brooke his company nor presence. But the hoodwink'd <hi>Anselmo</hi> answered him, that he would in no wise consent thereunto, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did weaue his owne dishonour a thousand waies, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to worke his contentment. In this season such was the delight that <hi>Leonela</hi> tooke also in her affections, as she suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her selfe to be borne away by them headlongly without
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:173111:212"/> any care or regard confident, because her Ladie did couer it, yea, and sometimes instructed her how she might put her desires in practise, without any feare or danger. But finally <hi>Anselmo</hi> heard on a night some body walke in <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelas</hi> chamber, and being desirous to know who it was, as he thought to enter, he felt the doore to be held fast against him, which gaue him a greater desire to open it, and therefore he strugled so long, and vsed such violence, as he threw open the dore, and entred iust at the time that another leaped out at the window, and therefore he ran ouer to ouertake him, or see wherein he might know him, but could neyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the one or the other, by reason that <hi>Leonela</hi> embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him hardly, with-held him and said, pacifie your selfe good Sir, and be not troubled, nor follow him that was here, for he is one that belongs to mee, and that so much as he is my spouse. <hi>Anselmo</hi> would not beleeue her, but rather blinde with rage, he drew out his poyniard, and would haue wounded her, saying, that she should presently tell him the truth, or else he would kill her. She distracted with feare, said, without noting her owne words: Kill me not Sir, and I will acquaint you with things which concerne you more then you can imagine. Say quickly then, quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> or else thou shalt die. It will be impossible, replied <hi>Leone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> for me to speake any thing now I am so affrighted, but giue me respite till morning, and I will recount vnto you things that will maruellously astonish you, and in the meane time rest secure; that he which leaped out of the window is a young man of this citie, betwixt whom and me hath passed a promise of marriage. <hi>Anselmo</hi> was somewhat satisfied by these words, and therefore resolued to expect the terme which she had demaunded to open her minde; for hee did not suspect that he should heare any thing of <hi>Camila,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he was already so assured of her vertue: and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the chamber, and shutting vp <hi>Leonela</hi> therin, threatning her withall that she should neuer depart thence vntill she had said all that she promised to reueale vnto him
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:173111:212"/> He went presently to <hi>Camila</hi> to tell vnto her all that which his mayden had said, and the promise she had passed, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close greater and more important things; whether <hi>Camila</hi> hearing this, were perplexed or no, I leaue to the discreete readers iudgement: for such was the feare which she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beleeuing certainely (as it was to be doubted) that <hi>Leonela</hi> would tell to <hi>Anselmo</hi> all that she knew of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, as she had not the courage to expect and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her surmise would become false or no: but the very same night as soone as she perceiued <hi>Anselmo</hi> to be asleepe, gathering together her best iewels and some money, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of her house vnperceiued of any, and went to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharios</hi> lodging, to whom she recounted al that had past, and requested him eyther to leaue her in some safe place, or both of them to depart to some place, where they might liue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure out of <hi>Anselmos</hi> reach. The confusion that <hi>Camila</hi> strucke into <hi>Lothario,</hi> was such, as he knew not what to say, and much lesse how to resolue himself what he might do. But at last he determined to carie <hi>Camila</hi> to a Monastery wherin his sister was Prioresse; to which shee easily condiscended, and therefore <hi>Lothario</hi> departed, and left her there with all the speed that the case required, and did also absent himselfe presently from the citie, without acquainting any body with his departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anselmo</hi> as soone as it was day, without heeding the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his wife, arose and went to the place where he had shut vp <hi>Leonela,</hi> with desire to know of her what she had promised to acquaint him withall: he opened the chamber dore and entred, but could finde no body therein, but some certaine sheets knit together, &amp; tied to the window as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine signe how <hi>Leonela</hi> had made an escape by that way. Wherfore he returned very sadde, to tell to <hi>Camila</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture; but when he could neither finde her at bedde, nor in the whole house, he remained astomed, and demaunded for her of his seruants, but none of them could tell him any thing. And as he searched for her, hee hapned to see her
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:173111:213"/> cofers lye open, and most of her jewels wanting, and heerewithall fell into the true account of his disgrace, and that <hi>Leonela</hi> was not the cause of his misfortune, and so departed out of his house sadde and pensiue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as hee was, halfe ready and vnapparelled to his friend <hi>Lothario,</hi> to recount vnto him his disaster: but when hee found him to bee likewise absented, and that the seruants told him how their master was departed the very same night and had borne away with him all his money, hee was ready to runne out of his wits. And to conclude, hee returned to his owne house againe, wherein he found no creature, man or woman, for all his folke were departed, and had left the house alone and desert: he knew not what he might thinke, say, or doe, and then his iudgement beganne to faile him. There he did contemplate and behold himselfe in an instant, without a wife, a friend, and seruants: abandoned (to his seeming) of heauen that couered him, and chiefly without honour, for hee clearly noted his owne perdition in <hi>Camilas</hi> crime. In the end he resolued, after he had bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a great while to goe to his friends Village wherein hee had beene all the while that hee afforded the leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue that disaster, and so shutting vp his house, he mounted a horse-backe, and rode away in languishing and dolefull wise. And scarce had he ridden the halfe way when he was so fiercely assaulted by his thoughts, as hee was constrained to alight, and tying his horse to a tree, he leaned himselfe to the trunke thereof, and breathed out a thousand pittifull and dolourous sighes: and there hee abode vntill it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most night; about which houre hee espied a man to come from the Cittie a horse-backe by the same way, and hauing saluted him, he demaunded of him what newes he brought from <hi>Florencia?</hi> the Cittizen replyed that the strangest that had hapned there many a day, for it is there reported publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Lothario</hi> the great friend of the rich man, hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the said <hi>Anselmos</hi> wife <hi>Camila</hi> this night, for shee is also missing, all which a waiting maide of <hi>Camilas</hi> hath
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:173111:213"/> confest, whom the gouernour apprehended yesternight, as shee slipt downe at a window by a paire of sheets, out of the said <hi>Anselmos</hi> house. I know not particulary the truth of the affaire, but well I wote, that all the Cittie is amazed at the accident, for such a fact would not bee as much as surmised, from the great and familiar amitie of them two, which was so much, as they were called the two friends. Is it perhaps yet knowen, quoth <hi>Anselmo,</hi> which way <hi>Lothario</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila</hi> haue taken? in no wise replyed the Cittizen, although the Gouernour hath vsed all possible diligence to finde them out. Farewell then good Sir, said <hi>Anselmo;</hi> and with you Sir, said the traualer, and so departed.</p>
               <p>With these so vnfortunate newes poore <hi>Anselmo</hi> arriued not only to termes of loosing his wits, but also welnigh of loosing his life: and therefore arising as well as he might, he came to his friends house, who had heard nothing yet of his disgrace; but perceiuing him to arriue, so wanne, pyned and dried vp, he presently coniectured that some grieuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill afflicted him. <hi>Anselmo</hi> requested him presently that hee might be carried to his chamber, and prouided of paper and inke to write withall; all was done, and he left at bed, and alone, for so he desired them; and also that the dore should bee fast locked: and being alone the imagination of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune gaue him such a terrible charge, as he clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that his life would shortly faile him, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to leaue notice of the cause of his suddaine and vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death: and therefore he beganne to write it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee could set an end to his discourse, his breath failed, and yeelded vp his life into the hands of sorrowe which his impertinent curiositie had stirred vp in him. The Gentleman of the house seeing that it grew late, and that <hi>Anselmo</hi> had not called, determined to enter and know whether his indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position passed forward: and hee found him lying on his face, with halfe of his body in the bed, and the other halfe leaning on the table whereon hee lay, with a written paper vnfolded: and held the pen also yet in his hand. His Host
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:173111:214"/> drew neare vnto him, and first of all hauing called him, hee tooke him by the hand: and seeing that hee answered not, and that it was cold, he knew that he was dead: and greatly perplexed and grieued thereat, hee called in his people that they might also be witnesses of the disastrous successe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmo:</hi> and after all he tooke the paper and read it, which he knew to bee written with his owne hand, the substance whereof was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A foolish and impertinent desire hath dispoiled mee of life. If the newes of my death shall arriue to</hi> Camila, <hi>let her also know that I doe pardon her, for shee was not bound to worke miracles; nor had I any neede to desire that shee should worke them. And seeing I was the builder and contriuer of mine owne dishonour, there is no reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherunto did <hi>Anselmo</hi> write, by which it appeared, that his life ended in that point ere he could set an end to the reason he was to giue. The next day insuing, the Gentleman his friend, acquainted <hi>Anselmos</hi> kinsfolke with his death: the which had already knowledge of his misfortune, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the Monasterie wherein <hi>Camila</hi> had retyred her selfe, being almost in termes to accompany her husband in that forcible voyage; not for the newes of his death, but for griefe of others which she had receiued of her absent friend. It is said that although shee was a widdow, yet would shee neither depart out of the Monasterie, nor become a religious woman, vntill shee had receiued within a few dayes after newes how <hi>Lothario</hi> was slaine in a battaile giuen by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieur de Lautrec</hi> to the great Captaine <hi>Goncalo Fernandez</hi> of <hi>Cordoua.</hi> In the Kingdome of <hi>Naples:</hi> and that was the end of the late repentant friend, the which being knowen to <hi>Camila</hi> she made a profession, and shortly after deceased be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the rigorous hands of sorrow and melancholie, and this was the end of them all, sprung from a rash and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate beginning.</p>
               <p>This nouell, quoth the Curate, hauing read it is a prettie one, but yet I cannot perswade my selfe that it is true, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:173111:214"/> if it be a fiction, the authour erred therein, for it cannot bee imagined, that any husband would be so foolish, as to make so costly an experience as did <hi>Anselmo.</hi> But if this accident had beene deuised betwixt a Gentleman and his loue, then were it possible, but being betweene man and wife, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines somewhat that is impossible and vnlikely: but yet I can take no exception against the manner of recounting thereof.</p>

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:173111:215"/> sitting downe in the chaire breathed forth a very deep sigh, and let fall her armes like a sicke and dismayed person. The Lackeyes carried away their horses to the stable Master Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate seeing and noting all this, and curious to know what they were that came to the Inne in so vnwonted an attyre, and kept such profound silence therein, went to the Lackeies and demaunded of one of them that which hee desired to know. Who answered him, In good faith Sir I cannot tell you what folke this is, only this I know, that they seeme to be very Noble, but chiefly hee that went and tooke downe the Ladie in his armes that you see there: and this I say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the others doe respect him very much, and nothing is done, but what hee ordaines and commaunds. And the Ladie, what is shee, quoth the Curate? I can as hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you, quoth the Lackey, for I haue not once seene her face in all this iourney, yet I haue heard her often grone and breathe out so profound sighes, as it seemes shee would giue vp the Ghost at euery one of them; and it is no maruaile that wee should know no more, then wee haue said, for my companion and my selfe haue beene in their companie but two dayes: for they incountred vs on the way and prayed and perswaded vs to goe with them vnto <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that they would recompence our paines largely. And hast thou heard them name one another, said the Curate? no truly answered the Lackey, for they all trauaile with such si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as it is a wonder, for you shall heare not a word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but the sighes and throbs of the poore Ladie, which doe moue in vs very great compassion, and wee doe questionlesse perswade our selues that shee is forced, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shee goes, and as it may bee collected by her attyre shee is a Nunne, or as is most probable goes to be one, and perhaps shee goeth so sorrowfull as it seemes, because shee hath no desire to become religious. It may very well be so, quoth the Curate; and so leauing them hee returned to the place where he had left <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who hearing the disguised Ladie to sigh so often mooued by the natiue compassion of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:173111:215"/> that sexe, drew neare her and said, what ailes you good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame? I pray you thinke if it be any of those inconueniences to which women bee subiect, and whereof they may haue vse and experience to cure them, I doe offer vnto you my seruice, assistance, and good will, to helpe you as much as lies in my power. To all those complements the dolefull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die answered nothing, and although <hi>Dorotea</hi> made her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine larger offers of her seruice, yet stood shee euer silent vntill the bemasked Gentleman (whom the Lackey said the rest did obay) came ouer and said to <hi>Dorotea:</hi> Ladie doe not trouble your selfe, to offer any thing to that woman, for shee is of a most ingratefull nature, and is neuer wont to gratifie any curtesie, nor doe you seeke her to answere vnto your demaunds, if you would not heare some lie from her mouth.

The Ladie moued with a sodaine passion turned her head at those outcries, and seeing shee could not perceiue him that gaue them, she got vp, and would haue entred into the roome, which the Gentleman es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying, withheld her, and would not let her stirre out of the place: and with the alteration and sodaine motion the maske fell off her face, and she discouered an incomparable beautie, and an angelicall countenance, although it was somewhat wanne and pale, and turned heere and there with her eies to euery place so earnestly as she seemed to be distracted: which motions without knowing the reason why they were made, strucke <hi>Dorotea</hi> and the rest that beheld her into very great compassion. The Gentleman held her very strongly fast by
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:173111:216"/> the shoulders, that hee more on his owne face that was falling, and was so busied therein, as hee could not hold vp the maske, as it did in the end wholy: <hi>Dorotea</hi> who had likewise embraced the Ladie, lifting vp her eyes by chance, saw that he which did also embrace the Ladie was her spouse <hi>Don Fernando:</hi> and scarce had she knowne him when breathing out along and most pitifull <hi>Alas</hi> from the bottome of her heart she fell backward in a trance. And if the Barber had not bin by good hap at hand, she would haue falne on the ground with all the waight of her bodie: the Curate presently repaired to take off the vaile of her face, and cast water thereon, &amp; as soone as he did discouer it, <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who was he indeed that held fast the other, knew her, &amp; looked like a dead man as soone as he viewed her, but did not all this let go <hi>Luscinda,</hi> who was the other whom he held so fast, and that laboured so much to escape out of his hands. <hi>Cardenio</hi> likewise heard the <hi>Alas</hi> that <hi>Dorotea</hi> said, when she fell into a trance, and beleeuing that it was his <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda,</hi> issued out of the chamber greatly altered, and the first he espied was <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> which held <hi>Luscinda</hi> fast; who forthwith knew him: and all the three, <hi>Luscinda, Cardenio,</hi> and <hi>Dorotea</hi> stood dumbe and amazed, as folke that knew not what had befalne vnto them. All of them held their peace, and beheld one another. <hi>Dorotea</hi> looked on <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando. Don Fernando</hi> on <hi>Cardenio, Cardenio</hi> on <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and <hi>Luscinda</hi> againe on <hi>Cardenio:</hi> but <hi>Luscinda</hi> was the first that broke silence, speaking to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> in this manner. Leaue me off Lord <hi>Fernando,</hi> I coniure thee, by that thou shouldest bee, for that which thou art; if thou wilt not doe it for any other respect: let me cleaue to the wall, whose Iuie I am, to the supporter from whom neither thy importunities nor threats, promises or gifts could once deflect mee. Note how heauen by vnusuall, vnfrequented, and from vs concca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waies, hath set my true spouse before mine eyes: and thou doest know well by a thousand costly experiences, that onely death is potent to blot forth his remembrance out of my memorie: let then so manifest truthes be of power (if
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:173111:216"/> thou must doe none other) to conuert thine affliction into rage, and thy good will into despight, and therewithall end my life, for if I may render vp the ghost in the presence of my deere spouse, I shall account it fortunately lost. Perhaps by my death he will remaine satisfied of the faith, which I euer kept sincere towards him, vntill the last period of my life. By this time <hi>Dorotea</hi> was come to her selfe, and listned to most of <hi>Luscindas</hi> reasons, and by them came to the knowledge of her selfe: but seeing that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> did not yet let her depart from betweene his armes, nor answere any thing to her words: encouraging her selfe the best that she might, she arose, and kneeling at his feete, and shedding a number of Cristall and penetrating teares she spoke to him thus.</p>
               <p>If it be not so my Lord, that the beames of that Sunne which thou holdest ecclipsed betweene thine armes, doe dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and depriue those of thine eyes, thou mightest haue by this perceiued how she that is prostrated at thy feet is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate (vntill thou shalt please) and the distastrous <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotea.</hi> I am that poore humble countriwoman, whom thou eyther through thy bountie, or for thy pleasure didst deigne to raise to that height that she might call thee her owne. I am she which sometime immured within the limits of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie did lead a most contented life, vntil it opened the gates of her recollection and wearinesse, to thine importunitie, and seeming iust, and amorous requests, and rendred vp to thee the keyes of her liberty, a greefe by thee so ill recompensed, as the finding my selfe in so remote a place as this: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you haue met with mee, and I seene you, may cleerely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, but yet for all this, I would not haue you to imagine that I come heere guided by dishonourable steps being onely hither conducted by the tracts of dolour, and feeling to see my selfe thus forgotten by thee. It was thy will, that I should be thine owne, and thou didst desire it in such a manner, as although now thou wouldst not haue it so, yet canst not thou possibly leaue off to be mine. Know my deare Lord that the matchlesse affection that I doe beare towards thee, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:173111:217"/> and be equiualent to her beautie and nobilitie, for whom thou doest abandon mee. Thou canst not be the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <hi>Luscindas,</hi> because thou art mine: nor she thine, for as much as she belongs to <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and it will be more easier, if you will note it well, to reduce thy will to loue her that adores thee, then to addresse hers that hates thee, to beare thee affection: Thou diddest sollicite my wretchles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; thou prayedst to mine integrtie, and wast not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of my qualitie: thou knowest also very well vpon what termes I subiected my selfe to thy will, so as there remaines no place, nor colour to terme it a fraud or deceit. And all this being so, as in veritie it is, and that thou beest as Christian as thou art noble, why doest thou with these so many vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wreathings dilate the making of mine ende happy, whose commencement thou diddest illustrate so much? and if thou wilt not haue me for what I am, who am thy true and lawfull spouse; yet at least take and admit mee for thy slaue, for so that I may be in thy possession, I will account my selfe happy and fortunate. Doe not permit that by leauing and abandoning mee, meetings may be made to discourse of my dishonour. Doe not vexe thus the declining yeares of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, seeing that the loyall seruices which they euer haue done as vassailes to thine, deserue not so honest a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. And if thou esteemest that thy bloud by medling with mine shall be stayned or embased: consider how fewe Noble howses or rather none at all are there in the world, which haue not runne the same way: and that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans side is not essentially requisite for the illustrating of noble descents, how much more, seeing that true nobilitie consists in vertue, which if it shall want in thee by refusing that which thou owest mee so iustly, I shall remaine with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more degrees of nobilitie then thou shalt. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion that which I will lastly say is, that whether thou wilt or no I am thy wife, the witnesses are thine owne words, which neither should nor ought to lie, if thou doest prize thy selfe of that for whose want thou despisest mee. Witnesse shall
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:173111:217"/> also be thine own hand writing. Witnesse heauen which thou didst inuoke to beare witnesse of that which thou didst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto mee: and when all this shall faile, thy very consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall neuer fayle from vsing clamours being silent in thy mirth and turning for this truth, which I haue said to thee now, shall trouble thy greatest pleasure and delight.</p>
               <p>These and many other like reasons did the sweetely grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Dorothea</hi> vse with such feeling and abundance of teares, as all those that were present, as well such as accompanied <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> as also the others that did accompany her. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> listened to her without replying a word, vntill she had ended her speech, and giuen beginning to so many sighes and sobs, as the heart that could indure to beholde them without mouing, were harder then brasse. <hi>Luscinda</hi> did also regard her, no lesse compassionate of her sorrow then admired at her discretion and beautie: and although she would haue approched to her, and vsed some consolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wordes, yet was she hindred by <hi>Don Fernandoes</hi> armes, which held her still embraced; who full of confusion and maruell, after she had stood very attentiuely beholding <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotea</hi> a good while, opening his armes, and leauing <hi>Luscinda</hi> free, said, Thou hast vanquished; O beautifull <hi>Dorotea,</hi> thou hast vanquished me. For it is not possible to resist or denie so many vnited truthes. <hi>Luscinda</hi> through her former traunce and weakenesse, as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> left her was like to fall, if <hi>Cardenio</hi> who stood behinde <hi>Don Fernando</hi> all the while, lest he should be knowne, shaking off all feare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering his person, had not started forward to stay her from falling, and clasping her sweetly betweene his armes, he said, if pittifull heauen be pleased, and would haue thee now at last take some ease my loyall, constant and beautifull ladie, I presume that thou canst not possesse it more securely, then betweene these armes which doe now receiue thee, as whilome they did when fortune was pleased, that I might call thee mine own: and then <hi>Luscinda</hi> first seuering her eye-lids, beheld <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and hauing first taken notice of him by
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:173111:218"/> his voyce, &amp; confirmed it againe by her sight, like one quite distracted, without farther regarding modest respects, she cast both her arms about his neck, &amp; ioyning her face to his, said; yea, thou indeed art my Lord: thou, the true owner of this poore captiue, howsoeuer aduerse fortune shall thwart it, or this life, which is only sustained and liues by thine, be euer so much thretned. This was a maruellous spectacle to <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> &amp; all the rest of the beholders, which did vniuersally admire at this so vnexpected an euent: and <hi>Dorotea</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to change color, as one resoluing to take reuenge on <hi>Cardenio,</hi> for he had set hand to his sword; which she coniecturing, did with maruellous expedition kneele, and catching holde on his legges, kissing them, she strained them with so louing embracements as he could not stirre out of the place, and then with her eyes ouerflowen with teares, said vnto him: what meanest thou to doe my onely refuge in this vnexpected traunce? Thou hast heere thine owne spouse at thy feete, and her whom thou wouldest faine pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, is betweene her owne husbands armes: iudge then whether it become thee, or is a thing possible to dissolue that which heauen hath knit, or whether it be any wise laudable to indeauour to raise and equall to thy selfe her, who contemning all dangers and inconueniences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in faith and constancy, doth in thy presence bathe her eyes with amorous liquor of her true loues face and bosom. I desire thee for Gods sake, and by thine owne worths, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest thee that this so notorious a verity may not onely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage thy choler, but also diminish it in such sort, as thou mayest quietly &amp; peaceably permit those two louers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their desires without any encumbrance, all the time that heauen shall graunt it to them: and herein thou shalt shew the generositie of thy magnanimous and noble breast, and giue the world to vnderstand how reason preuaileth in thee, and dominereth ouer passion. All the time that <hi>Dorotea</hi> spoke thus to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> although <hi>Cardenio</hi> held <hi>Luscin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> betweene his armes yet did he neuer take his eye of <hi>Don
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:173111:218"/> Fernando,</hi> with resolution, that if he did see him once stir in his preiudice, he would labour both to defend himselfe, &amp; offend his aduersary, &amp; all those that should ioine with him to do him any harme as much as he could, although it were with the rest of his life: but <hi>Don Fernandos</hi> friends, the Curate and Barber who were present and saw all that was past repayred in the meane season, without omitting the good <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and all of them together compassed <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> intreating him to haue regard of the beautifull <hi>Doroteas</hi> teares, and it being true (as they beleeued it was) which she had said he should not permit her to remain defrauded of her so iust &amp; lawful hopes. And that he should ponder how it was not by chance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the particular prouidence and disposition of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that they had al met together so vnexpectedly. And that he should remember as Master Curate said very wel, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death could seuer <hi>Luscinda</hi> from her <hi>Cardenio.</hi> And that although the edge of a sword might deuide and part them a sunder, yet in that case they would account their death most happie, and that in irremedilesse euents, it was highest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by straining and ouercomming himselfe to shew a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minde, permitting that he might conquer his owne will they two should ioy that good, which heauen had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die granted to them, and that he should conuert his eyes to behold the beautie of <hi>Dorotea,</hi> and he should see that few or none could for feature paragon with her; and much lesse excell her, and that he should confer her humilitie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme loue which she bore to him, with her other indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and principally that if he gloried in the titles of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or Christianitie, hee could not doe any other then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the promise that he had past to her: and that by fulfilling it, hee should please God, and satisfie discreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which know very well, how it is a speciall prerogatiue of beautie, though it be in an humble and meane subiect, if it bee consorted with modestie and vertue, to exalt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall it selfeto any dignitie, without disparagement of him which doth helpe to raise, or vnite it to himselfe. And when
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:173111:219"/> the strong lawes of delight are accomplished (so that there intercurre no sinne in the acting thereof) hee is not to bee condemned which doth follow them. Finally, they added to these reasons, others so many and forcible, that the vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous breast of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> (as commonly all those that are warmed and nourished by Noble bloud are wont) was mollified, and permitted it selfe to bee vanquished by that truth which he could not denie though hee would: and the token that hee gaue of his being ouercome, was to stoupe downe and imbrace <hi>Dorotea,</hi> saying vnto her, arise Ladie, for it is not iust that shee bee prostrated at my feete; whose Image I haue erected in my minde, and if I haue not hitherto giuen demonstrations of what I nowe auerre, it hath perhaps befallen through the disposition of heauen, to the end that I might by nothing the constancie and faith wherewithall thou dost affect me, know after how to valewe and esteeme thee according vnto thy merits: and that which in recompence thereof I doe intreate of thee is, that thou wilt excuse in me mine ill maner of proceeding, and exceeding carelesnesse in repaying thy good will. For the very occasion and violent passions that made me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thee as mine, the very same did also impell me againe not to be thine: and for the more verifying of mine asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe but once behold the eyes of the now contented <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinda,</hi> and thou mayest reade in them a thousand excuses for mine errour: and seeing she hath found and obtained her hearts desire: and I haue in thee also gotten what is most conuenient; for I wish she may liue securely and ioyfully, many and happy yeares with her <hi>Cardenio,</hi> for I will pray the same, that it will license me to enioy my beloued <hi>Dorotea:</hi> and saying so, he embraced her againe, and ioyned his face to hers with so louely motion, as it constrayned him to holde watch ouer his teares, least violently bursting forth, they should giue doubtlesse arguments of his feruent loue, and remorse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardenio, Luscinda,</hi> and almost all the rest could not doe
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:173111:219"/> so, for the greater number of them shed so many teares, some for their priuate contentment, and others for their friends, as it seemed, that some grieuous and heauy misfortune had betided them all: euen very <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> wept, although he excused it afterward, saying, that he wept onely because that he saw that <hi>Dorotea</hi> was not the Queene <hi>Micomicona</hi> as he had imagined, of whom he hoped to haue receiued so great gifts and fauours. The admiration and teares ioyned, indured in them all for a pretty space, and presently after <hi>Cardenio</hi> and <hi>Luscinda</hi> went and kneeled to <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> yeelding him thankes for the fauour that hee had done to them, with so courteous complements, as he knew not what to answere; and therfore lifted them vp, and embraced them with very great affection and kindenesse; and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he demaunded of <hi>Dorotea</hi> how she came to that place, so farre from her owne dwelling? And she recounted vnto him all that she had tolde to <hi>Cardenio:</hi> whereat <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and those which came with him tooke so great delight as they could haue wished that her story had continued a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time in the telling then it did, so great was <hi>Doroteas</hi> grace in setting out of her misfortunes. And as soone as she had ended, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> tolde all that had befalne him in the Citie, after that he had found the scroule in <hi>Luscindas</hi> bosome, wherein she declared <hi>Cardenio</hi> to be her husband; and that he therefore could not marry her, and also how he attempted to kill her, and would haue done it, were it not that her parents hindred him, and that he therefore departed out of the house full of shame and despite, with resolution to reuenge himselfe more commodiously; and how he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the next day following, how <hi>Luscinda</hi> was secretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her fathers house, and gone no body knew where; but that he finally learned within a few moneths after that she had entred into a certain Monastery, with intention to remain there all the daies of her life, if she could not passe them with <hi>Cardenio:</hi> and that as soone as he had learned that, choosing those three Gentlemen for his associates, hee
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:173111:220"/> came to the place where she was, but would not speake to her, fearing lest that as soone as they knew of his being there they would increase the guardes of the Monastery, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expected vntill he found on a day the gates of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery open; and leauing two of his fellowes to keepe the doore, he with the other entred into the Abbey in <hi>Luscindas</hi> search, whom they found talking with a Nunne in the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and snatching her away er'e she could retire her selfe, they brought her to a certaine village, where they disguised themselues in that sort they were; for so it was requisite for to bring her away. All which they did with the more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Monastery was seated abroad in the fields, a good way from any village. He likewise told, that as soone as <hi>Luscinda</hi> saw her selfe in his power, she fell into a sound, and that after she had returned to her selfe, she neuer did any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but weepe and sigh, without speaking a word; and that in that manner, accompanied with silence and teares, they had arriued to that Inne, which was to him as gratefull as an arriuall to heauen, wherein all earthly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are concluded and finished.</p>

               <p>Well and securely may you sleepe <hi>Sir Knight of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie countenance,</hi> as long as it shall please your selfe, without troubling your selfe with any care of killing any Giant, or of restoring the Queene to her Kingdome, for all is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; done already. I beleeue thee very easily, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for I haue had the monstrousest and most terrible battell with that Giant, that euer I thinke to haue all the dayes of my life with any; and yet with one thwart blow thawacke I ouerthrew his head to the ground: and there is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued so much bloud, as the streames thereof ran along the earth, as if they were of water. As if they were of red wine, you might better haue said, replied <hi>Sancho Panca:</hi> for I would let you to vnderstand, if you know it not already, that the dead Giant is a bored wine bagge: and the bloud, sixe and thirty gallons of redde wine which it contained in his belly: the head that was slasht off so neatly is the whoore my mother, and let the Diuell take all away for me. And what is this thou sayest madde man (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?)</hi> Art thou in thy right wits? Get vp Sir (quoth <hi>Sancho)</hi> and you your selfe shall see the faire stuffe you haue made, and what we haue to pay, and you shall beholde the Queene
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:173111:221"/> transformed into a particular Ladie called <hi>Dorotea,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther successes, which if you may once conceiue them aright, will strike you into admiration, I would maruell at nothing, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for if thou beest well remembred, I tolde thee the other time that we were here, how all that succeeded in this place, was done by inchantment, and what wonder then if now the like should eftsoones befall? I could easily be induced to beleeue all, replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> if my canuas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Couerlet were of that nature. But indeed it was not, but most reall and certaine. And I saw well how the Inkeeper that is here yet this very day aliue, held one end of the Couerlet, and did tosse me vp towards heauen with very good grace and strength, no lesse merrily then lightly: and where the notice of parties intercurs, I doe beleeue, although I am a simple man, and a sinner, that there is no kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, but rather much trouble, bruising and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Well God will remedie all, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and giue me mine apparrell, for I will get vp and goe forth, and see those successes and transformations which thou speakest of. <hi>Sancho</hi> gaue him his clothes, and whilst he was a making of him readie, the Curate recounted to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and to the rest, <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> mad prankes, and the guile hee had vsed to bring him away out of the poore Rocke, wherein he imagined that hee liued exiled through the disdaine of his Lady. Hee told them moreouer all the other aduentures, which <hi>Sancho</hi> had discouered, whereat they did not laugh a little and wonder withall, because it seemed to them all to bee one of the extrauagantest kinds of madnesse, that euer befell a distracted braine. The Curate also added, that seeing the good successe of the Lady <hi>Dorotea</hi> did impeach the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecuting of their desigue, that it was requisite to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent &amp; finde some other way, how to carry him home to his own village. <hi>Cardenio</hi> offred himself to prosecute the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; <hi>Luscinda</hi> shold represent <hi>Doroteas</hi> person. No, quoth <hi>Don Fernādo,</hi> it shal not be so, for I wil haue <hi>Dorotea</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute her own inuention. For so that the village of this good Gentleman be not very far off from hence I will be very glad
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:173111:221"/> to procure his remedy. It is no more then two daies iourney from hence said the Curate, wel though it were more replied <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> I wold be pleased to trauel them, in exchange of doing so good a worke. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sallied out at this time completely armed with <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, although with a great hole in it on his head, his target on his arme, &amp; leaned on his Trunke or Iaueline: his strange countenance &amp; gate amazed <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his companions very much, seeing his ilfauoured visage so withered and yealow, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and insutability of his armes, and his graue manner of proceeding: and stood all silent to see what he would: who casting his eyes on the beautifull <hi>Dorotea</hi> with very great grauity and stayednesse said.</p>
               <p>I am informed (beautifull Ladie) by this my Squire, that your greatnesse is annihilated, and your being destroyed: for of a Queene and mightie Princesse which you were wont to bee, you are now become a particular Damzell: which if it hath bene done, by particular order of the magicall king your father, dreading that I would not be able to giue you the necessarie and requisite helpe for your restitution; I say that he neither knew nor doth know the one halfe of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, and that he was very little acquainted with Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of chiualry, for if he had read them, or passed them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with so great attention and leasure, as I haue done and read them, he should haue found at euery other step how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knights of a great deale lesse fame then my selfe haue ended more desperate aduentures, seeing it is not so great a matter to kill a Giant be he euer so arrogant: for it is not many howres since I my selfe fought with one, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued I will not say, least they should tell me that I doe lie, but time the detector of all things will disclose it, when we do least thinke thereof, thou foughtest with two wine bagges, and not with a Giant quoth the host at this season, but <hi>Don Fernando</hi> commaunded him to be silent and not interrupt <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in any wise, who prosecuted his speech say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In fine I say high and disenherited Ladie, that if your
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:173111:222"/> father hath made this <hi>met amorphoses</hi> in your person for the causes related, giue him no credit: for there is no perill so great on earth, but my sword shall open a way through it, wherewithall I ouerthrowing your enemies head to the ground, will set your crowne on your owne head within a few dayes. Heere <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> held his peace, and awaited the Princesses her answere, who knowing <hi>Don Fernandos</hi> determination and will, that she should continue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced guile vntil <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> were carried home againe, answered with a very good grace and countenance in this manner. Whosoeuer informed you valorous Knight <hi>of the ill fauored face,</hi> that I haue altered and changed my being, hath not told you the truth: for I am the very same to day, that I was yesterday: true it is, that some vnexpected, yet fortunate successes haue wrought some alteration in me, by bestowing on me better hap, then I hoped for, or could wish my selfe: but yet for all that I haue not left off to be that which before, or to haue the very same thoughts, which I euer had, to helpe my selfe by the valour of your most valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inuincible arme. And therefore I request you good my Lord of your accustomed bounty to returne my father his honour againe, and account of him as of a very discreete and prudent man: seeing that he found by this skill, so easie and so infallible a way to redresse my disgraces. For I doe certainly beleeue, that if it had not beene by your meanes, I should neuer haue hapned to attaine to the good fortune, which now I possesse, as all these Noblemen present may witnesse: what therefore rests, is, that to morrow morning we doe set forward, for to day is now alreadie so ouergone, as we should not be able to trauaile very farre from hence: as for the conclusion of the good successe that I do howerly expect, I referre that to God, and the valour of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible arme.</p>
               <p>This much the discreet <hi>Dorotea</hi> said, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard her, he turned him to <hi>Sancho</hi> with very manifest tokens of indignation and said. Now I say vnto thee little
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:173111:222"/>
                  <hi>Sancho,</hi> that thou art the veryest rascall that is in all <hi>Spaine:</hi> tell me theefe and vagabond, didst not thou but euen very now say vnto me that this Princesse was turned into a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and that called <hi>Dorotea?</hi> and that the heade which I thought I had slashed from a giants shoulders, was the whore which bore thee? with a thousand other follies, which did plunge men into the greatest confusion that euer I was in, in my life? I vow (and then he looked vp on heauen, and did crash his teeth together) that I am about to make such a wracke on thee, as shall beate wit into the pates of all the lying Squires that shall euer hereafter serue Knights errant in this world. I pray you haue patience good my Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Sancho,</hi> for it may very well befall mee, to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in that which toucheth the transmutation of the Ladie and Princesse <hi>Micomicona:</hi> but in that which concerneth the Giants head, or at least the boaring of the wine bagges, and that the bloud was but red wine, I am not deceiued I sweare. For the bagges lie yet wounded there within at your owne beds head: and the red wine hath made a lake in the chamber: and if it bee not so, it shall be perceiued at the frying of the egges, I meane that you shall see it, when Master Inkeepers worship, who is heere present shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the losse and dammage: I say the <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> that thou art a madcap, pardon me, and so it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. It is enough indeed quoth <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me intreate you to say no more of this, and seeing my Ladie the Princesse saies she will go away to morrow, seeing it is now to late to depart to day, let it be so agreed on, and we will spend this night in pleasant discourses vntill the approach of the insuing day, wherein we will all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and attend on the worthy Knight Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we would be eye-witnesses of the valorous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable feates of armes, which he shall doe in the pursuit of this waightie enterprize, which he hath taken vpon him: I am he that will serue and accompany you good my Lord replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and I doe highly gratifie the honour
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:173111:223"/> that is done mee, and the good opinion that is held of me, the which I will indeuour to verifie and approoue, or it shall cost mee my life, or more, if more it might cost mee.</p>
               <p>Many other words of complement and gratification past betweene <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando:</hi> but a certaine passenger imposed silence to them all, by his arriuall to the Inne, in that very season, who by his attire shewed that hee was a <hi>Christian</hi> newly returned from among the <hi>Moores,</hi> for he was apparrelled with a short skirted cassocke of blew cloth, sleeues reaching downe halfe the arme, and without a coller; his breeches were likewise of blew linnen, and hee wore a bonnet of the same colour, a payre of date colour buskins, and a Turkish Cimitar hanging at his necke in a scarfe: which went athwart his breast, there entred after him riding on an Asse a woman clad like a <hi>Moore,</hi> and her face couered with a pecce of the vaile of her head, she wore on her head a little cap of cloath of gold, and was couered with a little Turkish mantle, from the shoulders downe to the feete. The man was of strong and comely making, of the age of fortie yeares or there abouts, his face was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tanned, he had long <hi>Mostacheos,</hi> and a very hansome beard. To conclude, his making was such as if he were well attired, men would take him to be a person of quality, and good birth: he demaunded a chamber as soone as hee had entred, and being answered that there was no one vacant in the Inne, he seemed to be grieued, and comming to her which in her attire deuoted her selfe to be a <hi>Moore,</hi> he tooke her downe from her Asse. <hi>Luscinda, Dorotea,</hi> the hostesse, her daughter, and <hi>Maritornes,</hi> allured to behold the new and strange attire of the <hi>Moore</hi> compassed her about and <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who was alwaies most gracious, courteous, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, deeming that both she and her that had brought her were discontented for the want of a lodging she said. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be not grieued for the trouble you are heere like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for want of meanes to refresh your selfe, seeing it is
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:173111:223"/> an vniuersall and vsuall vice of all Innes to be defectiue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: yet notwithstanding if it shall please you to passe away the time among vs (pointing to <hi>Luscinda)</hi> perhaps you haue met in the discourse of your trauels, other worse places of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment then this shall proue. The disguised Lady made none answere, nor other thing then arising from the place wherein she sate, and setting both her hands a crosse on her bosome, she inclined her head, and bowed her bodie in signe that she rendred them thanks: by her silence they doubtlesly coniectured her to bee a <hi>Moore,</hi> and that shee could not speake the <hi>Castilian</hi> tongue. In this, the captiue arriued who was otherwise imployed vntill then, and seeing that they all had inuironed her that came with him, and that she made no answere to their speech, he said. Ladies this maiden scarce vnderstands my tongue yet, nor doth she know any other thē that of her owne countrey, and therefore she hath not, nor can make any answere to your demaunds: We dmaund no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her quoth <hi>Luscinda,</hi> but onely doe make her an offer of our companies for this night, and part of her roume where we our selues shall be accommodated, where she shall be cherished vp as much as the commodity of this place, and the Obligatiō wherin we be tied to shew courtesies to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that may want it, doe binde vs, especially she being a woman, to whom we may do this seruice. Sweet Lady I kisse your hands both for her &amp; my selfe replied the captiue, and I do highly prize, as it deserueth the fauour you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which in such an occasion, &amp; offred by such persons as you seeme to be, doth very plainly shew how great it is: tell me good Sir quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> whether is this Lady a <hi>Christian</hi> or a <hi>Moore?</hi> for by her attire &amp; silence she makes vs suspect that she is, that we would not wish she were. A <hi>Moore</hi> she is in attire &amp; body, answered the captiue: but in mind she is a very feruent <hi>Christian,</hi> for she hath very expresly desired to become one. Then she is not yet baptized, said <hi>Luscinda?</hi> there hath beene no oportunitie offered to vs quoth the captiue to christen her since she departed from <hi>Argell,</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:173111:224"/> which is her Towne and Country: and since that time shee was not in any so eminent a danger of death, as might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her to be baptized, before shee were first instructed in al the ceremonies which our holy Mother the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: but I hope shortly (if it shall please God) to see her baptized with that decency, which her quality and calling deserues, which is greater then her attire or mine makes shew of.</p>
               <p>Thefe wordes inflamed all the hearers with a great desire to know, who the <hi>Moore</hi> and her captiue were; yet none of them would at that time intreate him to satisfie their longing, because the season rather inuited them to take som order how they might rest after their trauailes, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of them the discourse of their liues. <hi>Dorotea</hi> then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, caused her to sit downe by her selfe, and prayed her to take off the veile from her face: shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beheld the Captiue, as if shee demaunded of him, what they said; and hee in the <hi>Arabicall</hi> language told her, how they desired her to discouer her face and bad her to do it, which presently shee did, and discouered so beautifull a visage, as <hi>Dorotea</hi> esteemed her to bee fairer then <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and <hi>Luscinda</hi> prized her to excell <hi>Dorotea,</hi> and all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders perceiued, that if any one could surpasse them both in beautie, it was the <hi>Moore;</hi> and there were some that thought shee excelled them both in some respects. And as beautie hath euermore the prerogatiue and grace to reconcile mens minds, and attract their wils to it; so all of them forth with dedicated their desires to serue and make much of the louely <hi>Moore. Don Fernando</hi> demaunded of the Captiue, how shee was called, and hee answered that her name was <hi>Lela Zoraida,</hi> and as soone as shee heard him, and vnderstood what they had demaunded, shee suddainely answered with anguish, but yet with a very good grace, no, not <hi>Zoraida,</hi> but <hi>Maria, Maria,</hi> giuing them to vnderstand that shee was called <hi>Maria,</hi> and not <hi>Zoraida.</hi> These wordes and the great affect and vehemencie wherewithall the <hi>Moore</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:173111:224"/> them, extorted more then one teare from the hearers, especially from the women, who are naturally tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and compassiue. <hi>Luscinda</hi> embraced her then with great loue, and said. I, I, <hi>Maria, Maria,</hi> to which shee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I, I, <hi>Maria; Zoraida mancange:</hi> that is, and not <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raida.</hi> By this it was growen some foure of the clocke in the afternoone, and by order of those which were <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandos</hi> companions, the Inkeeper had prouided for them as good a beauer as the Inne could in any wise affoord vnto them. Therefore it being the houre, they sate downe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at a long table, for there was neuer a square or round one in all the house, and they gaue the first and principall end (although hee refused it as much as hee could) to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who commaunded that the Ladie <hi>Micomicona</hi> should sit at his elbow, seeing hee was her champion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently were placed <hi>Luscinda,</hi> and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and <hi>Cardenio</hi> right ouer against them, and after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and other Gentlemen, and on the other side the Curate and Barber: and thus they made their drinking with very great recreation, which was the more augmented to see <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> leauing of his meate, and moued by the like spirit of that which had made him once before talke so much to the Goate-heards, beginne to offer them an occasion of speech in this manner.</p>
               <p>Truely, good Sirs, if it be well considered, those which professe the order of Knighthood doe see many great, and vnexpected things. If it be not so, say, what mortall man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue is there that entring in at this Castle gate, and seeing of vs all in the manner we be now present here, can iudge and beleeue that we are those which wee be? who is it that can say, that this Ladie which sits here at my sleeue, is the great Queene that wee all know her to bee, and that I am that <hi>Knight of the heauie countenance,</hi> that am so much blab'd of abroade by the mouth of fame? therefore it cannot be now doubted but that this arte and exercise excelleth all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which euer humane wit, the vnderminer of nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:173111:225"/> and it is the more to be prized, by how much it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it selfe more then other trades to dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. Away with those that shall affirme learning to surpasse armes, for I will say vnto them, be they what they list, that they know not what they say. For the reason which such men doe most vrge, and to which they most relye, is, that the trauailes of the spirit doe farre exceede those of the body: and that the vse of armes are only exercised by the body, as if it were an office fit for porters, for which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were requisite but bodily forces, or as if in that which wee that professe it doe call armes, were not included the acts of Fortitude, which require deepe vnderstanding to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, or as if the Warriours minde did not labour as well as his body, who had a great armie to leade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or the defence of a besieged Cittie. If not, see if hee can arriue by his corporall strength, to know or sound the intent of his enemy, the designes, stratagems, and difficulties, how to preuent iminent dangers, all these being operations of the vnderstanding, wherein the body hath no medling at all: it being therefore so, that the exercise of armes require spirit as well as those of learning; let vs now examine which of the two spirits, that of the Scholler, or Souldier, doe take most paine? and this may bee best vnderstood by the end, to which both of them are addressed, for that intention is most to be esteemed, which hath for obiect the most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end. The end and conclusion of learning is, I speake not now of Diuinitie whose scope is to leade and addresse soules to heauen, for to an end so much without end as this, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be compared, I meane of humane sciences and arts, to maintaine <hi>distributiue iustice</hi> in his perfection, and giue to euery one that which is his owne: to indeauour and cause good lawes to bee religiously obserued; an end most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, generous, high, and worthy of great praise: but not of so much as that, to which the exercise of armes is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next, which hath for his obiect and end, peace: which is the greatest good men can desire in this life: and therefore the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:173111:225"/> first good newes that euer the world had, or men receiued, were those which the Angels brought on that night which was our day when they sung in the skies: <hi>Glorie bee in the heights, and peace on earth, to men of good mindes.</hi> And the salutation which the best Master that euer was on earth or in heauen, taught to his Disciples and fauourites, was that, when they entred into any house, they should say: <hi>Peace be to this house.</hi> and many other times he said: <hi>I giue vnto you my peace; I leaue my peace vnto you: peace bee amongst you:</hi> It is a good, as precious as a jewell, and a gift giuen, and left by such a hand: a jewell without which neither on earth or in heauen can there bee any perfect good. This peace is the true end of warre, for armes, and warre are one and the selfe same things. This truth being therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed, that the end of learning: let vs descend to the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall labours of the Scholler, and to those of him which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth armes, and consider which of them are more toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did prosecute his discourse in such sort, and with so pleasing termes, as he had almost induced his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to esteeme him, to be at that time at least, exempt from his frensie: and therefore by reason that the greater number of them were Gentlemen, to whom the vse of armes is in a manner essentiall and proper, they did willingly listen to him, and therefore hee continued on with his discourse in this manner. I say then that the paines of the Student are commonly these: principally pouerty (not that I would maintaine that all Students are poore, but that I may put the case in the greatest extremity it can haue) and by saying that he may be poore, me thinks there may be no greater aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his misery. For he that is poore, hath no perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this pouerty is suffered by him sundry waies, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by hunger, other times by cold or nakednesse, and many times by all of them together. Yet it is neuer so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, but that he doth eate, although it be somewhat later
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:173111:226"/> then the custome; or of the scraps and reuersion of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and the greatest misery of the Student is that which they terme, to liue by saps and pottage: and though they want fire of their owne, yet may they haue recourse to their neighbours chimney, which if it doe not warme, yet will it weaken the cold; and finally, they sleepe at night vnder a roofe. I will not descend to other trifles, to wit, the want of shirts and shoes, the barenesse of their clothes: or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerloading of stomacks with meate, when good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune lends them as good a meale: for by this way which I haue decyphered so rough and difficult: stumbling here, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there, getting vp againe on the other side, and refalling on this, they attaine the degree which they haue desired so much, which many hauing compassed as wee haue seene, which hauing passed through these difficulties, and sailed by <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> (borne away flying in a manner by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable fortune) they command and gouerne all the world from a chaire, turning their hunger into sacietie, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse into pompe, and their sleeping on a matte, into a sweet repose among Hollands and Damaske: a reward iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited by their vertue; but their labours confronted and compared to those of the militant Souldier, remaine very far behinde, as I will presently declare.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ON-QVIXOTE continuing his discourse said. Seeing wee beginne in the Student with pouerty and her parts, let vs examine whether the Souldier be richer? certainely wee shall finde that no man can exceede the Souldier in pouerty it selfe. For hee is tyed
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:173111:226"/> to his wretched pay which comes either late or neuer: or else to his owne shifts with notable danger of his life and conscience, and his nakednesse is oftimes so much as many times a leather jerken gashed, serues him at once for a shirt and an ornament: and in the midst of winter he hath sundry times no other defence or helpe to resist the inclemencies of the aire in the midst of the open fields, then the breath of his mouth; which I verily beleeue doth against nature come out cold, by reason it sallies from an emptie place: expect there till the night fall, that hee may repaire all these discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the easinesse of his bed, the which if it be not through his owne default, shall neuer offend in narrownesse, for hee may measure out for it on the earth as many foot as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and tumble himselfe vp and downe in it without indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the wrinckling of his sheetes. Let after all this the day and houre arriue, wherein he is to receiue the degree of his profession. Let, I say, a day of battaile arriue, for there they will set on his head, the Cappe of his dignitie, made of lints to cure the wound of some bullet that hath past throw and throw his temples, or hath maimed an arme or a legge, and when this doth not befall, but that heauen doth piously keepe and preserue him whole and sound; he shall perhaps abide still in the same pouerty wherein hee was at the first; and that it bee requisite that one and another battaile doe succeede, and he come of euer a victour to the end that he may prosper, and be at the last aduanced. But such miracles are but few times wrought, and say good Sirs if you haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, how few are those which the warres rewards, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the others that it hath destroyed? you must answere without question that there can be no comparison made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, nor can the dead be reduced to any number, but all the liuing and such as are aduanced, may be counted easily with three arithmeticall figures; all which fals out contrary in learned men, for all of them haue wherewithall to entertaine and maintaine themselues by skirts, I will say nothing of sleeues: So that although the Souldiers labour is
<pb facs="tcp:173111:227"/> greater, yet is his reward much lesse. But to this may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it is easier to reward two hundred thousand learned men, then thirty thousand Souldiers; for they may be aduanced by giuing vnto them offices which must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be bestowed on men of their profession: but Souldiers cannot be recompensed otherwise then by the Lords sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and wealth whom they serue; and yet this obiection and impossibility doth fortifie much more my assertion.</p>
               <p>But leauing this apart which is a labyrinth of very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult issue, let vs returne to the preeminency of armes ouer learning; which is a matter hitherto depending, so many are the reasons that euery one alleageth for himselfe: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those which I my selfe haue repeated, then learning doth argue thus for it selfe, that armes without it cannot be long maintained, for as much as the warre hath also lawes, and is subiect to them, and that the lawes are contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of learning, and belong to learned men. To this obiection, Armes doe make answere, that the lawes cannot be sustained without them, for commonwelths are defended by armes, and Kingdomes preserued, Citties fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, high waies made safe, the Seas freed from Pirates: and to be briefe, if it were not for them, Commonwelths, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Monarchies, Citties, and wayes by Sea and Land, would be subiect to the rigour and confusion which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the warre all the time that it indureth, and is licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to practise his prerogatiues and violence: And it is a knowen truth, that it which cost most is or ought to be most accounted of, that one may become eminent in learning, it costs him time, watchings, hunger, nakednesse, head-aches, rawnesse of stomacke, and other such inconueniences, as I haue partly mentioned already. But that one may arriue by true termes to be a good Souldier, it costs him al that it costs the Student, in so exceeding a degree, as admits no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, for he is at euery step in jeoperdie to loose his life. And what feare of necessity, or pouerty, may befall or molest a Student so fiercely as it doth a Souldier, who seeing himself
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:173111:227"/> at the siege of some impregnable place, and standing Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell in some Raueline or halfe Moone, feeles the enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining neere to the place where he is, and yet dares not to depart or abandon his stand, vpon no occasion whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or shunne the danger which so nearely threatens him; but that which he only may doe, is to aduise his Captaine of that which passeth, to the end he may remedy it by some countermine, whilest he must stand stil fearing and expecting when he shal suddainly flie vp to the clowds without wings, and after descend to the depths against his will. And if this appeare to be but a small danger, let vs way whether the grapling of two gallies, the one with the other in the midst of the spacious Maine, may be compared, or doe surpasse it, the which nailed and grapled fast the one to the other, the Souldier hath no more roome in them, then two foot broad of a planke on the battailings, and notwithstanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he clearly see laid before him so many ministers of death, for all the peeces of artillery that are planted on the aduerse side, doe threaten him, and are not distant from his body the length of a launce: and seeing that if he slipt euer so little aside, he should fall into the deepes: doth yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse with vndaunted heart, borne away on the wings of honour, which spurreth him onward, oppose himselfe as a worke to all their shot, and striues to passe by that so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a way into the enemies vessell: And what is most to bee admired, is to behold how scarce is one fallen into that place; from whence hee shall neuer after arise vntill the worldes end, when another takes possession of the same place: and if he doe likewise tumble into the Sea, which gapes like an enemy for him also, another and another will succeede vnto him, without giuing any respite to the times of their death, valour, and boldnesse, which is the greatest that may be found among all the traunces of warfare. Those blessed ages were fortunate which wanted the dreadfull fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the diuelish and murdering peeces of Ordenance, to whose inuentor I am verily perswaded that they render in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:173111:228"/> hell an eternall guerdon for his Diabolicall inuention; by which he hath giuen power to an infamous, base, vile and dastardly arme, to bereaue the most valorous Knight of life; and that without knowing how or from whence, in the midst of the stomacke and courage that inflames and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates valorous mindes, there arriues a wandring bullet (shot off perhaps by him that was affraid, and fledde at the very blaze of the powder, as he discharged the accursed engine) and cuts off and finisheth in a moment the thoughts and life of him who merited to enioy it many ages.</p>
               <p>And whilest I consider this I am about to say that it grieues me to haue euer vndertaken the exercise of a Knight errant in this our detestable age; for although no danger can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright me, yet notwithstanding I liue in iealousie to thinke how powder and Lead might depriue me of the power to make my selfe famous and renouned by the strength of mine arme &amp; edge of my sword throughout the face of the earth. But let heauen dispose as it pleaseth, for so much the more shal I be esteemed, if I can compasse my pretentions, by how much the dangers were greater, to which I opposed my selfe, then those atchieued in foregoing times by Knights aduenturous.</p>

                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made all this prolixe speech, whilest the rest of his company did eate, wholly forgetting to taste one bit, although <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> did now and then put him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his victuals, saying that hee should haue lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough after, to speake as much as he could desire. In those that had heard was againe renued a kinde of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to see a man of so good a witte as he seemed to be, and of so good discourse in all the other matters which he tooke in hand, to remaine so clzerely deuoyd of it, when any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of speech were offered, treating of his accursed Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Curate applauded his discourse, affirming that hee produced very good reasons for al that he had spoken in the fauour of armes, and that he himselfe (although he was lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Graduated) was likewise of his opinion. The Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:173111:228"/> being ended, and the table clothes taken away, whilest <hi>Maritornes</hi> did helpe her Mistresse &amp; her daughter to make ready the roome where <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had slept for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, wherein they alone might retire themselues that night. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> intreated the captiue to recount vnto them the history of his life, for as much as he suspected that it must haue beene rare and delightfull, as he gathered by the tokens he gaue, by comming in the louely <hi>Zoraydas</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. To which the captiue replied, that he would accomplish his desire with a very good will, and that onely he feared that the discourse would not proue so sauory as they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But yet for all that he would tell it, because hee would not disobey him: the Curate and all the rest thanked him for his promise, and turned to request him againe to begin his discourse; and he perceiuing so many to sollicite him, said, that prayers were not requisite, when commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were of such force, and therefore I desire you, quoth he, to be attentiue, and you shall heare a true discourse, to which perhaps no fained inuention may be compared for variety, or delight. The rest animated by these his wordes, did accommodate themselues with very great silence, and he beholding their silence and expectation of his history, with a modest and pleasing voyce, began in this manner.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a certaine village of the Mountaines of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> my lineage had beginning, wherewithall nature dealt much more liberally then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, although my father had the opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the penury and pouerty of that people, to be a rich man, as indeed he might haue beene, had he but
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:173111:229"/> vsed as much care to hoard vp his wealth, as prodigality to spend it. And this his liberall disposition proceeded from his being a souldier in his youthfull yeares: for warre is the schoole wherein the miser is made francke, and the francke man prodigall: and if among souldiers wee finde some wretches and niggards, they are accounted Monsters which are seldome seene. My father passed the bounds of liberality, and touched very neerely the confines of prodigality; a thing nothing profitable for a married man, who had children that should succeed him in his name and being. My father had three sonnes, all men, and of yeares sufficient to make an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the state of life they meaned to leade. Wherefore he perceiuing as he himselfe was wont to say, that he could not bridle his nature in that condition of spending, he resolued to depriue himselfe of the instrument and cause, which made him such a spender and so liberall, to wit, of his goods; without which <hi>Alexander the great</hi> himselfe would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a miser: and therefore calling vs all three together on a day into his chamber, he vsed these or such like reasons to vs.</p>
               <p>Sonnes, to affirme that I loue you well, may be presumed, seeing I terme you my sonnes: and yet it may be suspected that I hate you, seeing I doe not gouerne myselfe so well as I might, in the husbanding and increasing of your stocke. But, to the end that you may from henceforth perceiue that I doe affect you with a fatherly loue, and that I meane not to ouerthrow you like a step-father, I will doe one thing to you which I haue pondered, and with mature deliberation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed these many dayes: You are all of age to accept an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or at least to make choice of some such exercise, as may turne to your honour and profite at riper yeares: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which I haue thought vpon, is to deuide my goods into foure parts; the three I will bestow vpon you, to euery one that which appertaines to him, without exceeding a iot, and I my selfe will reserue the fourth, to liue and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me with as long as it shall please heauen to lend mee
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:173111:229"/> breath. Yet I doe greatly desire that after euery one of you is possest of his portion, hee would take one of the courses which I meane to propose. There is an old prouerbe in this our <hi>Spaine,</hi> in mine opinion very true, (as ordinarily all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs are, being certaine briefe sentences collected out of long and discreete experiences) and it is this; <hi>The Church, the Sea, or the Court:</hi> The meaning whereof is, That whosoeuer would become wealthy, or worthy must either follow the Church, haunte the Seas by exercising the trade of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, or get him a place of seruice, and entertainement in the Kings house, for men say that <hi>A Kings crumme is more worth then a Lords loafe.</hi> This I say because I desire, and it is my will, that one of you doe follow his booke, an other merchandize, and the third the warre; seeing that the seruice of his owne house is a difficult thing to compasse. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the warre is not wont to inrich a man, yet it addes vnto him great worth and renoune. Within these eight dayes I doe meane to giue you all your portions in money, without defrauding you of a mite, as you shall see in effect. Therefore tell me now whether you meane to follow mine opinion and aduice in this which I haue proposed. And then he commaunded me by reason that I was the eldest, to make him an answere.</p>
               <p>I, after I had intreated him not to make away his goods, but to spend and dispose of them as he listed, seeing that we were both young and able enough to gaine more; at last I concluded that I would accomplish his will, and that mine was to follow the wars, therein seruing God and my King together. The second brother made the same offer, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his portion in commodities, would venter it to the <hi>Indias.</hi> The youngest, and as I deeme the discreetest, said, that eyther he would follow the Church, or goe at the least to <hi>Salamanca</hi> to finish his already commenced studies. And as soone as we had ended the agreement and election of our vocations, my father embraced vs all, and afterwards perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto vs, in as short a time as he had mentioned, all that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:173111:230"/> he promised; giuing vnto each of vs a portion, amounting, if doe well remember, to three thousand duckats, a piece in money: for an vncle of ours bought all the goods and paide ready money, because he would not haue them made away from our owne familie and lineage. We all tooke our leaue of our good father in one day, and in that instant it seeming to me a great inhumanity to leaue my father so old, and with so little meanes; I dealt so with him, as I constrayned him to take backe againe two thousand duckats of the three he had giuen me, for as much as the rest was sufficient to furnish me in very good sort with all things requisite for a souldier. My brothers, moued by mine example, did each of them giue him a thousand crownes: so that my father remained with foure thousand crownes in money, and three in goods, as they were valued; which goods he would not sell, but keepe them still in stocke. Finally, we bad him (and our said vncle) farewell, not without much feeling and many teares on both sides: and they charged vs that we would from time to time acquaint them with our successes, whether prosperous or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse. We promised to performe it, and then embracing vs, and giuing vs his blissing, one departed towards <hi>Salamanca,</hi> another to <hi>Siuill,</hi> and my selfe to <hi>Alicante.</hi> I arriued pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Milaine,</hi> where I did accommodate my selfe with armes, and other braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vsed by souldiers, and departed from thence to settle my selfe in <hi>Piemonte,</hi> and being in my way towards the Citie of <hi>Alexandria de la Paglia,</hi> I heard newes that the great Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> did passe towards <hi>Flanders.</hi> Wherefore changing my purpose, I went with him, and serued him in all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he made: I was present at the beheading of the Earles of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Hornes,</hi> and obtained at last to be ensigne to a famous Captaine of <hi>Guada-lasara,</hi> called <hi>Diego de Vrbina.</hi> Within a while after mine arriuall to <hi>Flanders</hi> the newes were diuulged of the league that <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us quintus</hi> the Pope of famous memory, had made with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> against our common enemy the <hi>Turke,</hi> who had
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:173111:230"/> gained by force the famous Island of <hi>Cypres,</hi> much about the same time, which Island belonged to the state of <hi>Venice,</hi> and was an vnfortunate &amp; lamentable losse. It was also certainly known, that the most noble <hi>Don Iohn of Austria,</hi> our good King <hi>Don Philips</hi> naturall brother did come downe for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this league, &amp; the geat prouision that was made for the warre was published euery where.</p>
               <p>All this did incite and stirre on my minde and desire to be present at that expedition so much expected: and therefore although I had coniectures, and halfe promises to be made a Captaine in the first occasion that should be offered, yet I resolued to leaue all those hopes, and goe into <hi>Italie,</hi> as in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect I did. And my good fortune so disposed, as the Lord <hi>Don Iohn of Austria</hi> arriued iust at the same time at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and went towards <hi>Naples,</hi> to ioyne himselfe with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Nauie, as he did after at <hi>Messina.</hi> In this most fortunate iourney I was present, being by this made a Captaine of foote: to which honourable charge, I was mounted rather by my good fortune, then by my deserts. And that very day which was so fortunate to all <hi>Christendome:</hi> for therein the whole world was vndeceiued, and all the nations thereof freed of all the errour they held, and beliefe they had, that the <hi>Turke</hi> was inuincible at Sea: in that very day I say, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the swelling stomacke, and <hi>Ottomanicall</hi> pride was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among so many happy men as were there (for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> that were slaine were much more happy then those which they left victorious aliue) I alone was vnfortunate, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in exchange of some <hi>Naual crowne,</hi> which I might expect, had I liued in the times of the auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> I found my selfe the night ensuing, that so famous a day with my legges chained, and my hands manacled, which befell in this manner: that <hi>Vchali</hi> King of <hi>Argiers,</hi> a bolde and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Pirate, hauing inuested and distressed the Admirall of <hi>Malta</hi> (for onely three Knights remained aliue, and those very sore wounded) <hi>Iohn Andreas</hi> chiefe Gallie came to her succour, wherein I went with my company: and doing what
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:173111:231"/> was requisit in such an occasion, I leapt into the enemies ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, the which falling off from that which had assaulted her, hindred my souldiers from following me; by which means I saw my selfe alone amidst mine enemies, against whō I could make no long resistance, they were so many. In fine, I was taken full of wounds. Now as you may haue heard, <hi>Vchali</hi> saued himselfe and all his squadron, whereby I became cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in his power, and onely remained sorrowfull among so many ioysull, and captiue among so many freed: for that day fifteene thousand <hi>Christians,</hi> which came slaues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained in the <hi>Turkish Gallies</hi> recouered their desired liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I was carried to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the great <hi>Turke Selim,</hi> made my Lord Generall of the Sea, by reason that he had so well performed his duety in the battell, hauing brought away for a witnesse of his valour the Standard, of the order of <hi>Malta.</hi> I was the yeare insuing of 1572. in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarino,</hi> rowing in the Admirall of the three <hi>Lanthornes,</hi> and saw and noted there the oportunity that was lost, of taking all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Nauie within the hauen: for all the <hi>Genisaries</hi> and other souldiers that were in it, made full account, that they should be set vpon, euen within the very port, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trussed vp all their baggage, and made ready their shoes to flie away presently to the land, being in no wise minded to expect the assault, our Nauie did strike such terrour into them. But God disposed otherwise of the matter, not through the fault or negligence of the Generall that gouerned our men, but for the sinnes of <hi>Christendome,</hi> and because God permits and wils, that we haue alwaies some executioners to chastice vs. In summe, <hi>Vchali</hi> got into <hi>Modon,</hi> which is an Island neere to <hi>Nauarino,</hi> and landing his men there, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the mouth of the hauen, and there remained vntil <hi>Don Iohn</hi> departed. In this voyage was taken the Gally called <hi>Presa,</hi> whereof the famous Pirate <hi>Barbarossas</hi> his sonne was Captaine: it was surprised by the head Galley of <hi>Naples</hi> called the <hi>shee Wolfe,</hi> that was commaunded by the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt of warre, the father of souldiers, that fortunate and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:173111:231"/> ouerthrowne <hi>Don Aluaro de Bacan,</hi> the <hi>Marquesse of Sancta Cruez.</hi> And here I will not forget to recount what befell at the taking of the Presa: this sonne of <hi>Barbarossas</hi> was so cruell, and vsed his slaues so ill, that as soone as they that were rowing perceiued the shee Wolfe to approach them, and that she had ouertaken them, they cast away their Oares all at one time, and laying hands on their Captain that stood on the <note n="*" place="margin">Estande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril. p. 442.</note> Poope, crying to them to row with more speede, and passing him from one bancke to another, from the Poope to the Prow, they tooke so many bits out of him, as he had scarce passed beyond the Mast, when his soule was already wasted to hell: such was the cruelty wherewithall he intreated them, and so great the hate they also bore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. We returned the next yeare after to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> being that of seuenty and three, and there we learned how <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had gained <hi>Tunez,</hi> and taking that Kingdom away from the <hi>Turkes</hi> had by installing <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cut away all <hi>Muley Hamedas</hi> hopes to raigne againe there, who was the most cruell and valiant <hi>Moore</hi> that euer liued.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Turke</hi> was very much grieued for this losse, and therefore vsing the sagacity wherewithall all his race were indued, he made peace with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for much more then he did himselfe: and the yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of seuenty and foure he assaulted the fortresse of <hi>Goleta,</hi> and the other fortresse that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had raised neere vnto <hi>Tunez:</hi> and in all these occasions I was present, tyed to the Oare, without any hope of liberty; at least wise by ransome, being resolued neuer to signifie by letter my misfortunes to my father. The <hi>Goleta</hi> was lost in fine, and also the Fortresse before which two places lay in siege seuenty fiue thousand <hi>Turkes,</hi> and more then foure hundred thousand <hi>Moores,</hi> and other <hi>Sarasins</hi> of all the other parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with such abundance of munition and warlike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and so many Pioners as were able to couer <hi>Goleta</hi> and the Fortresse, if euery one did cast but his handfull of earth
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:173111:232"/> vpon them. Thus was <hi>Goleta</hi> accounted, vntill then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, first lost, the which did not happen through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of valour in the defendants, who in defence thereof did all they could, or ought to haue done; but because ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shewed the facilitie wherewithall trenches might be raised in that desert sand; for though water had beene found in it within two spannes depth, the <hi>Turkes</hi> could not finde it in the depth of two yeards; and therefore filling many sacks full of sand, they raised their trenches so high, as they did surmount the walles of the Sconce, and did so gall the defendants from them with their shot, as no one could stand to make any defence: it was a cōmon report, that our men would not immure themselues within <hi>Goleta,</hi> but expect the enemy in the champaine, at their disembarquing: but those that gaue this out spake widely, as men very little acquainted with the like affaires: for if in <hi>Goleta</hi> and the Fortresse, there were scarce seuen thousand Souldiers, how could so few a number were they euer so resolute, make a sallie, and remaine in the Forts, against so great a number of enemies? or how is it possible, that the forces which are not seconded and supplyed, should not be ouercome, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being besieged by many, and obstinate enemies, and those in their owne Countrey. But many others esteemed, and so did I likewise among the rest, that almighty God did a particular grace and fauour vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> in that manner permitting to bee destroyed the stop and cloake of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse; and the sponge and Moath of innumerable summes of money spent there vnprofitably, without seruing to any other end, then to preserue the memory of being gayned by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, as if it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for the keeping of it eternall (as it is, and shall bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) that those stones should sustaine it. The Fortresse was also wonne, but the <hi>Turkes</hi> were constrained to gaine it, span by spanne, for the Souldiers which defended it fought, so manfully and resolutely, as the number of the enemies slaine in two and twenty generall assaults which they gaue vnto
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:173111:232"/> it, did passe fiue and twenty thousand. Neuer a one was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner, but three hundred which suruiued their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, a certayne and manifest token of their valour and strength, and how well they had defended themselues and kept their fortresses: a little Fort or turret that stood in the midst of the place.</p>
               <p>Vnder the command of <hi>Don Iohn Zanoguera a Valentian</hi> Gentleman, and famous Souldier, was yeelded vp on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and <hi>Don Pedro de Puertocarrero</hi> Generall of <hi>Gole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> was taken prisoner, who omitted no diligence possible to defend the place: but yet was so grieued to haue lost it as he dyed for very griefe on the way towards <hi>Constantinople</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they carried him Captiue. The Generall likewise of the Fort, called <hi>Gabriel Cerbellon,</hi> being a Gentleman of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and a great enginer, and most resolute Souldier was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and there dyed in both the places many persons of worth, among which <hi>Pagan de Oria</hi> was one, a Knight of the order of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of a most noble disposition, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding liberality which he vsed towards his brother the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Iohn Andrea de Oria</hi> clearly demonstrates, and that which rendred his death more deplorable, was, that he was slaine by certaine <hi>Sarracines</hi> (which he trusted, perceiuing how the Fort was lost) who had offered to conuey him thence in the habit of a <hi>Moore</hi> to <hi>Tabarca,</hi> which is a little hauen or cricke possest by the <hi>Genoueses,</hi> that fish for <hi>Corral</hi> in that coast. These <hi>Sarracens</hi> cut off his head, and brought it to the Generall of the <hi>Turkish</hi> armie, who did accomplish in them the Spanish prouerbe; <hi>That although the treason pleaseth, yet is the Traitor hated:</hi> and so it is reported, that he commanded those to bee hanged that had brought him the present, because they had not brought it aliue.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Christians</hi> that were lost in the Fort, there was one called <hi>Don Pedro de Aguilar,</hi> borne in <hi>Andulizia,</hi> in some Towne whose name I haue forgotten, he had beene Auncient in the Fortresse, and was a Souldier of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and of a rare vnderstanding, and specially had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

This Gentleman made two Sonnets in forme of Epitaphes, the one for the <hi>Goleta</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Fort: and I will repeate them, because I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them very well, and doe beleeue that they will be rather gratefull, then any thing disgustfull to the audients, as soone as euer the Captiue named <hi>Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> beheld his <hi>Camaradas,</hi> and they all three did smile, and when he beganne to talke of the Sonnets, one of them said, before you passe further, I beseech you good Sir let me intreate you to tell me, what became of that <hi>Don Pedro de Aguilar,</hi> whom you haue named? that which I know of that affaire, answered the Captiue, is, that after he had beene two yeares in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he fledde away in the attyre of an <hi>Armenian,</hi> with a <hi>Greeke</hi> spie, and I cannot tell whether he recouered his liberty, or no; although I suppose he did, for within a yeare after I saw the <hi>Greeke</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but I had not the oportunity to demaund of him, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of that voyage. He came then into <hi>Spaine,</hi> quoth the Gentleman: for that same <hi>Don Pedro</hi> is my brother, and dwels now at home in our owne Towne, very well, rich, marryed, and a Father of three Sonnes. God bee thanked, quoth the Captiue, for the infinite fauour he hath shewed vnto him: for in mine opinion there is not on earth any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment able to be compared to that of recouering a mans lost liberty. I doe moreouer, said the Gentleman, know the Sonnets which my brother composed, I pray you then good Sir, quoth the Captiue, repeate them, for perhaps you can say them better then I; with a very good will, answered the Gentleman; and that of the <hi>Goleta</hi> is thus.</p>

               <p>The Sonnets were not misliked: and the Captiue was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recreated with the newes which he receiued of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and prosecuting his Historie, he said: The <hi>Goleta,</hi> and the Fort being rendred, the <hi>Turkes</hi> gaue order to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantell <hi>Goleta,</hi> for the Fort was left in such sort, as there remained nothing vp that might be ouerthrowen: and to do it with more breuity and lesse labour, they vndermined it in three places, but that which seemed least strong could not be blowen vp by any of them, which was the old walles; but all that which had remained a foote of the new fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and workes of <hi>Fratin</hi> fell downe to the ground with great facility: and this being ended the Nauie returned tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant and victorious to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> where within a few moneths afterward my Lord <hi>Ʋchali</hi> died, whom they called <hi>Vchali Fartax,</hi> which signifies in the <hi>Turkish</hi> language the scald or scurfie renegate, for he was such; and it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome among the <hi>Turkes</hi> to giue one another nicke names either of the defects, or perfections and vertues which they haue, and the reason hereof is, that among them all they haue but foure linages that haue surnames, and these doe contend with that of <hi>Ottomanes,</hi> for Nobility of bloud: and all the rest, as I haue said doe take denomination, sometime from the blemishes of the body, and sometime from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the minde: and this scuruie fellow did row fourteene yeares, being the great <hi>Turkes</hi> slaue, and did renounce his faith, being foure and thirty yeares old, for despight, and because he might be reuenged on a <hi>Turke,</hi> that gaue him a cuffe on the face as he rowed; and his valour was so great, as without ascending by the dishonourable meanes and waies vsually taken, the greatest minions about the great
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:173111:234"/>
                  <hi>Turke,</hi> he came first to be King of <hi>Argiers,</hi> and after to be Generall of the Sea, which is the third most Noble charge and dignitie of all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire. He was borne in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi> and was a good morall man, and vsed with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity his slaues, whereof hee had aboue three thousand, which were after his death deuided, as he had left in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, betweene the great <hi>Turke</hi> (who is euer an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to euery dead man, and hath a portion among the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased his children) and his runnegates. I fell to the lot of a <hi>Ʋenetian</hi> runnegate, who being a shippe-boy in a certaine vessell, was taken by <hi>Ʋchali,</hi> who loued him so tenderly, as he was one of the dearest youthes he had, and he became af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the most cruell runnegate that euer liued. He was called <hi>Azanaga,</hi> and came to be very rich, and King of <hi>Argiers:</hi> with him I came from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> somewhat contented in minde, because I should be nearer vnto <hi>Spaine;</hi> not for that I meaned to write vnto any one of my vnfortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, but only to see whether fortune would proue more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to me in <hi>Argiers,</hi> then at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where I had attempted a thousand waies to escape, but none of them sorted vnto any good effect: and I thought to search out in <hi>Argiers</hi> some other meanes to compasse that which I so greedily desired; for the hope of attayning liberty sometime had neuer abandoned me, and when in the contriuing, I thought, or put my designes in practise, and that the successe did not answere mine expectation, presently without forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me, it forged and sought out for another hope, that might sustaine me, although it were debile, and weake.</p>
               <p>With this did I passe away my life, shut vp in a prison or house, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call Bathes, wherein they do inclose the Captiue Christians as well those that belong to the king as other particular mens, and those which they call of the <hi>Almazen,</hi> which is as much to say, as slaues of the Counsell who are deputed to serue the Citie in the publike works and other affaires thereof, and these of all other Captiues doe with most difficulty attaine to liberty; free by reason they
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:173111:235"/> belong to the communalty, and haue no particular master, there is none with whom a man may treate of their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although they should haue the price of their ramsay. To these Bathes as I haue said, some particular mé carry their Captiues to be kept, chiefly if they be to be ransomed; for there they haue them at their ease &amp; secure, vntill they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed. The Kings Captiues of ransome also, do not go forth to labour with the other poore crew, if it be not when the paying of their ransom is deferred; for then, to the end they may make them write for money more earnestly, they make them labour, and goe to fetch wood with the rest which is no small toyle and trouble. I then was one of those of ransome; for as soone as it was knowne how I was a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, notwithstanding that I told them of my little possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and want of meanes, all could not preuaile to disswade thē from consorting me with the multitude of Gentlemen, and those of ransome, they put on me then a chaine, rather to be a token that I was there for my ransome, then to keepe me the better with it, and so I passed away my time there with many other Gentlemen, and men of marke held and kept in their for thy ransome. And although both hunger and nakednesse did vexe vs now and then, or rather euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, yet nothing did afflict vs so much as to heare and see euery moment the cruelties that my master vsed towardes <hi>Christians.</hi> Euery day he hanged vp one, he set this man on a slake, and would cut off the others eares, and that, for so little occasion, or wholy without it, as the very <hi>Turks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues perceiued, that be did it not for any other cause, but because he had a will to doe it, and that it was his naturall inclination to be a homicide of all humane kind. Onely one <hi>Spanish</hi> soldier called such a one of <hi>Sanuedra</hi> was in his good grace, who although hee did sundrie things that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the memory of that Nation for many yeares, and all to the end to get his liberty; yet he neuer strucke him, nor commaunded him to be strucken, nor said as much as an euell word vnto him: and yet we all feared that hee should
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:173111:235"/> be broached on a-stake for the least of many things which he did, and himselfe did also dread it more then once; and if it were not that time denieth me leasure to doe it, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto you things done by this souldier, which might both entertaine and astonish you much more then the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my life.</p>
               <p>There were ouer the square court of our prison certaine windowes that looked into it, and belonged to a certaine rich and principall <hi>Moore;</hi> the which windowes (as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily are all the <hi>Moores</hi> windowes) rather seemed to be holes then windowes: and euen these were also very closely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and shut fast with linnen couerings. It therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell that standing one day vpon the battlements of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with other three companions, trying which of vs could leape best in his shakles to passe away the time, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (for all the other Christians were gone abroad to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) I lifted vp by chance mine eyes, and I saw thrust out at one of those so close-shut windowes a cane, and a linnen tied at the end thereof, and the cane was moued and wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp and downe, as if it had made signes, that we should come and take it: we looked vpon it, and one of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions went vnder the cane, to see whether they would let it fall, or what they would doe else; but as soone as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it, the Cane was lifted vp, and did stirre it to eyther side, as if they had said (with wagging of the head) no the Christian returned to vs; and the Cane being eftsoones let fall, and beginning to moue as it had done before, an other of my fellowes went, and the same succeeded vnto him, that did to the first. Finally, the third approached it, with no better successe then the former two, which I perceiuing, would not omit to trie my fortitude, and as soone as I came neere to stand vnder the Cane, it was let slip and fel within the Bathes iust at my feete: I forthwith went to vntie the linnen which was knotted, wherein I found tenne <hi>Zianiys,</hi> which are certaine peeces of base gold, vsed among the <hi>Moores,</hi> and worth each of them tenne rials of our money.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:173111:236"/> I leaue to your discretion to thinke if I was not glad of my bootie, certes my ioy and admiration was much, to thinke whence that good might come vnto vs, but specially to my selfe, since the signes of refusall, to let it fall to the other did confirme cleerly that the fauour was only addrest to my selfe. I tooke my welcome money, broke the Cane, and returned to the battlements, and viewed the window earnestly, and perceiued a very beautifull hand issue out thereat, which did open and shut it againe very speedily. By which imagining and thinking that some woman that dwelled in that house, had done vs the charitie and benefit, in token of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minds, we made our courtesies after the <hi>Moorish</hi> sashion by inclining of our heads, bending of the bodie, and pressing our hands to our breasts, within a while after, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the same window a little crosse made of Canes, which presently was taken in againe, this signe did confirme vs in the opinion that there was some <hi>Christian</hi> woman cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in that place, and that it was shee which did to vs the courtesie: but the whitenesse of her hand, and her rich brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets destroyed this presumption: although we did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing coniecture that it was some renegate <hi>Christian,</hi> whom their masters there do very ordinarily take to wiues yea and account verie good hap to light on one of them, for they are much more accounted of, then the women of the nation it selfe.</p>
               <p>Yet-in all these discourses we strayed very farre from the truth, of the accident; and so from thence forward all our passing of the time was imployed in beholding that window as our North, wherein had appeared the starre of the Cane: but fifteene daies past ouer, or we could descrie either it, or the hand againe, or any other signe. And although in the meane time we endeuour all that we might to know who dwell in that house, or whether there were any renegate <hi>Christian</hi> therein, yet neuer a one could tell vs any other things but that it belonged to a very rich and noble <hi>Moore</hi> called <hi>Aguimorato</hi> who had beene Constable of the <hi>Pata,</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:173111:236"/> dignitie among them of very great qualitie. But when we thought least that it would raine any more <hi>Zianiys</hi> by that way we saw the Cane suddenly to appeare, and an other lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen hanging on it, whose bulke was much greater: and this befell when the bath was freed of concourse, and void, as the other time before. We made the accustomed triall, euery one approaching it before mee, but without effect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I came, for presently as I approached it, it was permitted to fall. I vntied the knot and found inwreathed in it fortie duckets of Spanish gold, with a letter written in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, and at the end therof was drawne a very great crosse. I kissed the crosse, tooke vp the money, and returned againe to the battlements, and we altogether made our receiuers, the hand also appeared, I made signes that I would reade the paper, and the window was shut incontinently. All of vs were maruellously astonished, yet ioyfull at that which had befalne vs, and by reason that none of vs vnderstood the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi> tongue, the desire that we had to vnderstand the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the letter was surpassing great, but greater the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to finde out some trustie person that might reade it. In the end, I resolued to trust in this affaire a renegate of <hi>Murcia,</hi> who did professe himself to be my very great friend, &amp; hauing by my liberality &amp; other good turnes done secretly obliged him to be secret in the affaire wherein I would vse him: for some renegates are accustomed when they haue an intention to turne into the <hi>Christian</hi> countries to bring with them the testimonies of the most principall captiues, wherein they informe, and in the amplest manner they may, how the bearer is an honest man, and that he hath euer done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good turnes to the <hi>Christians,</hi> and that he hath himselfe a desire to escape by the first commoditie. Some renegates there are, which procure those testimonies sincerely, and with a good intention, others take the benefit of them ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance or industrie; who intending to goe and rob into the countries of <hi>Christians,</hi> if by chance they be astray or taken, bring forth their testimonies and say, that by those
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:173111:237"/> papers may be collected the purpose wherwith all they came that is, to remaine in <hi>Christian</hi> countries, and that therefore, they came abroad a pyrating with the other <hi>Turks:</hi> and by this meanes they escape that first brunt, and are reconciled againe to the Church, without receiuing any harme at all: and when they espie their time doe returne againe into <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barie,</hi> to be such as they were before. Others there are, which procure those writings with a pure intention, and doe after stay in <hi>Christian</hi> countries. Well this my friend was a rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of his last kinde: who had the testimonies of all my companions, wherein we did commend him, as amply as we could deuise: and certainly if the <hi>Moores</hi> had found those papers about him, they would haue burnt him for it. I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how he could speake the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and not onely that alone, but also write it withall: yet before I would wholy breake my minde to him, I reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him to reade mee that scroule, which I had found by chance in a hole of my cabin, he opened it, and stood a good while beholding and construing thereof, murmuring some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what betweene his teeth. I demaunded therefore of him whether he vnderstood it? and he answered that he did, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: and that if I desired to haue it translated <hi>verbatim,</hi> I should bring vnto him Pen and Ink, to the end he might do it more completely: we presently gaue vnto him that which he asked, and he did translate it by little and little; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing finisht it, he said all that is heere in Spanish, is punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without omitting a letter, the contentes of the <hi>Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> paper, and heere you must note, that where it sayes <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> it meanes <hi>our Ladie the blessed Virgine Marie.</hi> We read the paper, whereof the contents were these which ensue.</p>

               <p>See, good Sir, if it was not great reason, that the reasons comprehended in this Letter should recreate and astonish vs. And certainly the one and the other was so great, as the runnagate perceiued well that the paper was not found by chance, but was really addressed vnto some one of vs: and therefore desired vs earnestly, that if that were true which he suspected, that we would trust and tell it vnto him, and hee would aduenture his life to procure our liberties: and saying this, he tooke out of his bosome a Crucifixe of mettle, and protested with very many teares by the God which that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage represented, in whom he, although a sinner and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, did most firmely beleeue, that he would be most
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:173111:238"/> loyall and secret to vs in all that which we would discouer vnto him; for it seemed to him, and he almost deuined that both himselfe and we all should recouer our liberties by her meanes that did write the Letter: and he should then also see himselfe in the state which he most desired, to wit, in the bosome of his mother the holy Catholicke Church; from which through his ignorance and sinne, he was departed and deuided as an vnprofitable and corrupt member. The Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate said this with so many teares, and such euident tokens of repentance, as all of vs consented to open our mindes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and declare the truth of the matter; and so wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vnto him the whole discourse, without concealing any circumstance; and shewed vnto him the window by which the Cane was wont to appeare, and he marked the house from thence, and rested with special charge to informe himselfe well of those that dwelled therein. We thought also that it was requisite to answere the <hi>Moorish</hi> Ladies Letter: and therefore hauing him present that could so well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that taske, we caused the renegate to draw out an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer presently as I did dilate it to him, which was punctually such as I will recount: for of all the most substantial points that befell me in that affaire, no one is falne out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, nor shall euer as long as I haue breath. In effect that which I answered to the <hi>Moore,</hi> was this.</p>

               <p>This Letter being written and inclosed, I expected two dayes, that the Bathes might be free of concourse, as it was wont, which assoone as it befel, I went vp to my accustomed place of the battlements, to see whether the Cane appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; which was presently afterthrust out at the window. And soone as I perceiued it, although I could not note who it was that set it, I shewed my paper, to giue them warning to set on the threed: but it was already hanging thereon. To the which I tied the Letter, and within a while after began to appeare our Starre, with the white flagge of peace, and the knotted linnen; which they let fall, and I tooke vp, and I found therein in diuers sorts of money and golde more then fiftie duckats, which redoubled our ioyes more then fifty times, and confirmed the hope wee conceiued of attayning libertie. The very same night our Renegate returned to vs, and tolde, how he had learned that the very same <hi>Moore</hi> which wee were informed of before called <hi>Aguimorata</hi> dwelt there, and was excessiue rich, and had one only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the heire of all his goods; of whom the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the citie was, that she was the fairest woman of all Barbarie: and that many of the <hi>Viceroyes</hi> that came there had demaunded her to wife, but she would neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend to any motion of mariage: and that he likewise had vnderstood, that she had somtimes a <hi>Christian</hi> captiue, which now was deceased, all which agreed with the contents of the Letter. We presently entred in counsell with the Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, about the meanes we were to vse, to fetch away the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:173111:239"/>
                  <hi>Moore,</hi> and come all of vs to <hi>Christian</hi> landes, and in the end we concluded to attend for that time, the second aduice of <hi>Zoraida</hi> (for so was she then called, who now meanes to name her selfe <hi>Maria)</hi> for as much as we cleerely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was shee, and none other that could minister to vs the meanes to remoue all these difficulties. After we had rested on this resolution, the Renegate bid vs be of good courage, for he would ingage his life, or set vs at liberty. Foure dayes after the Bathes were troubled with people: which was an occasion that the Cane appeared not all that while. But that impediment being remoued, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed solitude returned, the Cane did againe appeare with a linnen hanging thereat so grossely impregned, as it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be deliuered of a most happie burden. Both Cane and linnen bent themselues to me, and in them I found another paper and a hundred duckats in golde, besides other small money. The Renegate was present, and we gaue him the Letter to reade, the effect whereof was this.</p>

               <p>These were the contents of the second Letter, which being heard by vs all, euery one offered to bee himselfe the ransomed person, and promised to goe and returne with all punctuality, and I also made a proffer of my selfe: to all which resolutions the Renegate opposed himselfe, saying that he would consent in no wise that any one of vs should be freed, vntill we were all together deliuered: for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had taught him how euill ransomed men were wont to keepe those promises which they passed in the times of their thraldome: for many times certaine principall captiues had made that kinde of triall, redeeming of some one or other that should goe to <hi>Ʋalentia</hi> or <hi>Mallorca,</hi> with money to freight a Barke or Fregat, and returne for him that had ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed them, and did neuer returne againe: for the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red liberty, and the feare of aduenturing to lose it againe, concurring, did blot out of their memory all the other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the world. And to confirme the truth which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerred, he briefly recounted vnto vs an accident which befel much about the same time to certaine <hi>Christian</hi> Gentlemen, the strangest, as I suppose, that euer hapned in those quarters, wherein do succeede euery other day euents full of wonder and admiration, and therefore concluded, that what ought and might be done, was, that they should giue vnto him to buy a Barke, such money as they meant to imploy in the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of a captiue, &amp; he would buy it there in <hi>Argiers,</hi> vnder pretext of becomming a merchant &amp; sayler in <hi>Tetuan</hi> &amp; that cost: &amp; being once owner of a Barke, he would easily deuise how to haue them out of the Baths &amp; imbarke them al: how much more if the <hi>Moorish</hi> Ladie did, as she promised, giue them money enough to ransom them all, was it a most easie thing they being free, to embark thēselues at midday: but the greatest difficultie in this affaire was, that the <hi>Moores</hi> vse not to permit any Renegate to buy any Barke or other small vessell, but onely great vessels of warre: for they suspect that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:173111:240"/> he that buyes a Barke, especially if he be a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> does it for no other end but to runne away to Christian countries. And yet he knew how to facilitate that inconuenience, by inducing a <hi>Tangerine Moore</hi> to become his partner of the Barke, and the gaines that should be gotten by the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities thereof, and with this shaddow hee would become Lord of it himselfe, and therewithall accounted the matter ended. And although that both my selfe and my <hi>Camaradas</hi> held it the better course to send vnto <hi>Mallorca</hi> for one, as the <hi>Moorish</hi> Lady said, yet durst we not contradict him, fearefull that if we did not what he would haue vs to doe, he would discouer vs, and indanger our liues, if he did once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect <hi>Zoraidas</hi> practises; for the safeguard of whose life wee would all of vs most willingly aduenture our owne: and therfore we determined to put our selues into Gods and the Renegates hands. And so we answered at the same instant to <hi>Zorayda,</hi> telling her that we would accomplish all that she had admonished vs, because she had aduertised vs as wel as if <hi>Lela Marien</hi> had told her what she should say, and that the dilating or shortning of the affair did consist only in her selfe. I did offer my selfe anew to become her husband: and with this the day ensuing, wherein the Bath was also free, she sent me downe at diuers times by the Cane two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Duckats, and a Letter, wherein she said that she would goe to her fathers garden the next <hi>Iumia,</hi> that is the Friday following, and that before she went away she would giue vs more money. And that, if it were not enough we should aduise her, and she would giue vnto vs as much as we would demaund; for her father had so much treasure, as he would neuer perceiue it, how much more seeing she had, and kept the Keyes of all. We gaue fiue hundred crownes presently to the Renegate to buy a Barke, and with eight hundred I redeemed my selfe, giuing the money to a <hi>Valentian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which was at that season in <hi>Argiers,</hi> who did ransome me of the King, taking me forth on his word, which he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to pay my ransome, at the arriuall of the first Ship that
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:173111:240"/> should come from <hi>Ʋalentia.</hi> For if hee had deliuered the money instantly, it would haue giuen occasion to the King to suspect that my ransome was many dayes before in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> and that the Merchant had kept it silently, to make his benefite thereof. Finally, my Master was so cauilous as I durst not in any wise pay him presently.</p>
               <p>The Thursday before the Friday of the beautiful <hi>Zoraidas</hi> departure towards the garden, she gaue vnto vs other two thousand duckats, and did likewise aduise vs of her going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, intreating me that as soone as I had ransomed my selfe I should learne the way to the garden, and take occasion howsoeuer to goe to it, and see her. I answered her briefly, that I would doe so, and prayed her that she would careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend our proceedings to <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> with those prayers which the captiue had taught her. This being done, order was also giuen for the ransoming of my three compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to facilitate our issue out of the Bathes, and also that they seeing me free, and themselues vndeliuered, might not be troubled or perswaded by the Diuell, to doe any thing in preiudice of <hi>Zorayda.</hi> For although that they, being the men of that quality they were, might assure me from this feare, I would not for all that, aduenture the matter, and therefore I caused them to bee ransomed by the same meanes that I was redeemed my selfe, giuing all the money to the Merchant, that he might with the more security passe his word for vs: to whom yet we neuer did discouer our practise and secret, by reason of the eminent danger of the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thereof.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ifteene dayes were not fully expired, when the Renegate had bought him a very good Barke, able to holde thirty persons or more; and for the better colour and assurance of his businesse, he made a voyage to a place called <hi>Sargel,</hi> which is thirty leagues distant from <hi>Argiers</hi> towards the side of <hi>Oran,</hi> and is a great place of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique for drie Figges. He made this voyage twise or thrise in company with the <hi>Tagarine,</hi> of whom we made mention: and the name of <hi>Tagarino</hi> is in <hi>Barbary</hi> giuen to the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Arragon, Granada,</hi> and <hi>Mudesares.</hi> And in the Kingdome of <hi>Fez</hi> those <hi>Mudesares</hi> are called <hi>Elehes,</hi> and are the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that King doth most imploy in warlike affaires. You shall therefore vnderstand that euery time he passed by with his Barke he did cast Ancre in a little cricke, twise the shot of a Crosbow from the garden wherein <hi>Zorayda</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and there the Renegate would in very good earned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise himselfe with the Moores that rowed, eyther to flie or else to assault one another in iest, as he meant to doe after in good earnest: and would now and then goe to <hi>Zoraydas</hi> garden, and demaund fruits, which her father would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon him, without knowing what hee was: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee desired to haue spoken with <hi>Zorayda,</hi> as hee tolde mee afterward himselfe, and haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her, how it was hee that was to carry her away by my direction into the land of <hi>Christians,</hi> and that shee should therefore liue chearfull and secure, yet was it neuer possible, forasmuch as the women of that nation do not suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be viewed by any <hi>Moore</hi> or <hi>Turke</hi> if he be not their husband, or that their parents command them, yet do they
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:173111:241"/> haunt and communicate themselues to <hi>Christian</hi> captiues freely, and that sometimes more then is conuenient, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it would haue grieued me, that he should haue spoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, for perhaps it would haue perplexed her extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, to see her affaire committed to the trust of a runnegate: but God who did otherwise dispose it, did not concurre with this good desire of our renegate: who seeing how safely he went and returned from <hi>Sargel,</hi> and that he soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when and where he pleased; and that the <hi>Tagarmo</hi> his partner did only what he liked, and that I was ransomed, and nothing else wanting, but to finde out some <hi>Christians</hi> that would row, hee bad mee bethinke my selfe what men I would bring away with mee besides those that I had ranso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that I should warne them to bee ready against the next Friday, wherein hee was resolued that wee should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>Seeing this, I spake to twelue Spaniards very lusty rowers, and those that could with most liberty get out of the Citty: and it was not a little matter to finde so many there at that time, for there were twenty gallies abroad a robbing, which had carried all the other rowers with them, and these were left behinde because their Master did keepe at home that Sommer to finish a galley that was on the Stockes a making. To these I said nothing else, but only warned them that the Friday ensuing in the euening, they should closely steale out by one and one, and goe towards <hi>Aguimorates</hi> Garden, and there expect me vntill I came vnto them. I gaue this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to euery one of them a part, with order also, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they saw any other <hi>Christians</hi> there, they should tell them nothing else, but that I had commaunded them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me in that place. This diligence being vsed, yet wanted there another, which was the most expedient of all, to wit, to aduise <hi>Zoraida</hi> of the termes wherein our affaires did stand, to the end shee might be likewise ready and prepared, and not affrighted though wee did assault her before the time that shee could imagine the barke of the <hi>Christians</hi> to
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:173111:242"/> be come to fetch her away; and therefore I resolued to goe my selfe vnto the Garden and see whether I might speake with her: and taking the occasion to goe and gather some hearbs, I went vnto it the day before our departure, and the first person with whom I encountred was her father, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me in a language which in all <hi>Barbarie</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> is vsually spoken by the <hi>Moores</hi> to their captiues, and is neither, <hi>Arabian, Spanish,</hi> nor of any other nation, but rather a mixture of all languages wherewith all of vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand one another: he, I say, in that kinde of speech de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me, what I sought for in that his garden, and to whom I did belong? I answered that I was one <hi>Arnaute Mami</hi> his slaue (and this, because I was very certainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he was his intire friend) and that I came thither to gather of all sorts of hearbs to make a sallade: he conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently asked of me whether I was a man of ransome or no, and how much my Master demaunded for me? and being in those questions and demaunds, the beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the house into the garden, who had espyed me a good while before: and as the <hi>Moorish</hi> women doe not greatly estrange themselues from the sight of <hi>Christians,</hi> we are in their behauiour or conuersation with them any thing squeamish, as we haue said already, shee did not greatly feare to approch the place where her father talked with mee: but rather, her father perceiuing that shee came on somewhat slowly, did call, and commanded her to draw neare.</p>
               <p>It were a thing impossible for mee to recount the great beauty and gallant disposition, or the brauery and riches of attyre, wherein my beloued <hi>Zoraida</hi> then shewed her selfe to mine eyes. I will only say this, that there hanged more Pearles at her eares, superlatiue faire necke, and haire, then shee hath haires on her head, about the wrests of her legges, which were naked after the manner of her Countrey, shee wore two <hi>Carcaxes</hi> (for so the manicles or bracelets of the feete are called in the <hi>Morisco</hi> tongue) of the finest gold, wherein were inchaced so many Diamonds, that as shee told
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:173111:242"/> me after her father valued them at twenty thousand crowns; and those about the wrests of her hands, were of equall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme. Her pearles were many, and those most Orient; for all the chiefe brauery and ornament of the <hi>Moorish</hi> Ladies consists in the adorning of themselues with Pearles &amp; Pearle seede; by reason whereof there is more Pearles and Pearle-seede to be found among the <hi>Moores</hi> then among all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations of the world: and <hi>Zoraidas</hi> father had the fame to haue many, and those the very best that were in <hi>Argiers;</hi> and also aboue two hundred thousand Duckats of Spanish gold: of all which was shee the Lady, who now is mine. And if with all this ornament shee could then seeme faire, by the relikes that haue remained vnto her among so many labors, may bee easily ghessed, what shee would haue beene in the time of prosperity? for all of vs doe know that the beauty of some women hath limited dayes and seasons, and requireth certayne accidents either to diminish or increase it, and it is a thing naturall to the passions of the minde, either to raise, or abase it, but most commonly they wholly destroy it. To be briefe, I say, that shee arriued to the place where we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed at that time most richly atryred, and beautifull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond measure, or I at last deemed her the fairest that I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beheld vntill then: and herewithall remembring the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation wherein shee had tyed me, thought that some Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had presented it selfe to my view, being come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the earth, for my recreation and reliefe.</p>
               <p>As soone as shee was arriued her father told her in her owne language, how I was his friend <hi>Arnaute Mami</hi> his captiue, and that I came there to gather a sallade: then shee taking the speech, demaunded in that medly of tongues of which I haue spoken, whether I was a Gentleman, and what the reason was why I redeemed not my selfe? I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that I was already ransomed, and by the ransome might be coniectured, in how much my Master valued me, seeing hee had for my liberty a thousand and fine hundred <hi>Coltamis,</hi> to this shee answered; In good sooth, if thou
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:173111:243"/> werst my fathers, I would cause him not to giue thee for twice as much more: for you <hi>Christians</hi> are great lyars, and doe make euery one of your selues poore men, to defraude the <hi>Moores</hi> of their due ransome. It may well bee so Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, quoth I, but I haue for my part vsed all truth in this affaire with my Master, and doe, and will, vse truth with as many persons as I shall euer haue occasion to treate with in this world, and when dost thou goe away, quoth <hi>Zoraida?</hi> to morrow as I beleeue, quoth I. For there is a French ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell here, which sets forth to morrow, and I meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in her: were it not better, replyed <hi>Zoraida,</hi> to expect vntill vessels come out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and goe away with them, then with those of <hi>France,</hi> which are not your friends? no, quoth I, although if it were true as the newes runne, that there comes a vessell from <hi>Spaine,</hi> I would attend it; but yet it is more certaine that I shall depart to morrow: for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I haue to see my selfe at home in my Countrey, and with those persons whom I loue is so great, as it will not permit me to expect any other commodity, that foreslowes it selfe bee it neuer so good. Thou art doubtlefly marryed in thy Countrey, said <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and therefore desirest to goe see thy wife? I am not married, quoth I, but I haue passed my word to marry, as soone as I am there safely arriued. And is shee beautifull to whome thou hast past it, quoth <hi>Zoraida?</hi> so beautifull, said I, as to indeere it and tell you the truth, shee is very like vnto your selfe. Hereat her father laughed very hartily, and said. In good earnest <hi>Christian</hi> shee must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair that may compare with my daughter, who is the most beautifull of all this Kingdome: and if thou wilt not beleeue me looke on her well, and thou shalt see that I tell thee but the truth. He himselfe, as most perfect in the tongue, did serue for the interpreter of most of our speeches; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though shee could speake that illegitimate language which is there in vse, yet did shee manifest her mind more by signes then by wordes.</p>
               <p>Whilst thus wee reasoned of many matters, there came
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:173111:243"/> running towards vs a certaine <hi>Moore,</hi> and told his Master how foure <hi>Turkes</hi> had leaped ouer the Garden walles, and were gathering the fruits although they were not yet ripe. The old man and his daughter <hi>Zoraida</hi> started here at; for it is an vniuersall and naturall defect in the <hi>Moores</hi> to feare the <hi>Turkes,</hi> but specially the Souldiers of that nation, who are commonly so insolent, and haue such command ouer the <hi>Moores</hi> that are their subiects, as they doe vse them worse then if they were their slaues. Therefore <hi>Zoraidas</hi> father said vnto her; daughter retyre thy selfe into the house, and keep thy selfe in whilest I goe speake to those dogges; and thou <hi>Christian</hi> goe and seeke out thine hearbs, and depart in good houre, and I pray <hi>Alà</hi> to conduct thee safely to thy Country. I inclined my selfe to him, and he departed to search out the <hi>Turkes,</hi> leauing me alone with <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who began to make adoe as if she went whither her father had commanded her; but scarce was hee couered among the trees of the Garden when shee returned to me, with her eyes full of teares, said. <hi>Amexi Christiano Amexi,</hi> that is, goest thou away <hi>Christian,</hi> goest thou away? I answered, yes Ladie, that I doe, but I will neuer depart away without thee: expect mee the next Friday, and be not affrighted when thou shalt see vs, for we will goe to the <hi>Christian</hi> Countrey then, without all doubt. This I said to her in such sort as she vnderstood all my words very well, and casting her arme ouer my necke, shee began to trauaile with languishing steps towards the house, and fortune would (which might haue beene very ill, if heauen had not rectified it) that as we walked together in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme, her father, who did by this returne after hee had caused the <hi>Turkes</hi> to depart, espyed vs, and we saw also very well how he had perceiued vs: wherefore <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who is very discreet, would not take away her arme from my necke, but rather drew nearer vnto me, and laid her head on my brest, and bowed her knees a little, with euident token that shee swouned, and I likewise made as though I did su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine her vp by force. Her father came running ouer towards
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:173111:244"/> vs, and seeing his daughter in that state, demanded the cause of her, but seeing shee made no answere, hee himselfe said, she doubtlesly is dismaide by the suddaine affright she tooke at the entrance of those Dogges: and taking her away from me, he bowed her to his owne brest: and shee breathing out a sigh, with her eyes yet full of teares, said againe, <hi>Amexi Christiano Amexi,</hi> goe away <hi>Christian,</hi> goe away: to which her father replyed, there is no cause daughter why the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> should goe away, for he hath done thee no harme, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> are already departed. Sir they haue affrighted her (quoth I) as you haue said, but yet since shee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded mee to goe away, I will not offend her; therefore rest in peace, for I will returne, if it please you to giue mee leaue, for hearbs to this garden, when it is needfull; for my Master saies there are none better to be found for sallades in any other garden, then you haue here in this: come as oft as thou wilt, said <hi>Aguimorato,</hi> for my daughter saies not this, in respect that thou or any other <hi>Christian</hi> hath offended her, but that, meaning to say, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> should goe away, shee bad thee to depart, or else shee spake it, because it is time for thee to gather thine hearbs.</p>
               <p>With this I tooke leaue of both, and she seemed at the instant of my departure to haue had her heart torne away from her, as she departed with her father; and I vnder colour of seeking herbs, went about all the garden at my leasure, and viewed all the sallies, and the entrances thereof, the strength of the house, and the commodities that might bee offered to facilitate our enterprise. This being done, I came home and made a relation to the renegate, and my other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of all that had passed: and did long infinitely to see the hower wherein I might, without any affright or danger, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse that happinesse which fortune in the faire and louely <hi>Zoraida,</hi> offered vnto mee. In fine the time passed ouer, and the so much desired day and terme arriued: and euery one of vs following the order, which with mature consideration and long discourse wee had agreed on, we found the good
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:173111:244"/> successe we desired. For the very Friday following the day wheerin I had spoken with <hi>Zoraida</hi> in the garden, <hi>Morre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nago</hi> (for so was the renegate called) neere night cast anchor almost right before the place wherein the beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> remained. The <hi>Christians</hi> also that were to row, were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and hidden in sundrie places there abouts. All were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and resolutely expected my comming, desirous to set vpon the Barke that was before their face: for they knew not of the agreement that was betweene mee and the rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; but rather made full account that they were to gaine their liberty by force of armes, and killing the <hi>Moores</hi> that came in that vessell.</p>
               <p>It therefore befell, that as soone as I and my fellowes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, all the rest that were hidden, and espied vs, made forthwith ouer towards vs. This was at an hower when the Citie gates were shut, and neuer a bodie abroad among all those fields: and when wee were altogether, wee were in doubt whether it would be best, first to goe and fetch <hi>Zorai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> or to imprison &amp; stone the <hi>Tagarine Moores,</hi> that rowed in the frigat. And being in this doubt, the renegate came to vs, asking vpon what we slayed, for it was now high time to be going away and all his <hi>Moores</hi> were wretchlesse, and the greater number of them a sleepe: We told him then the cause of our slay, and he answered that it was of most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, first to subiect the vessell which might be done with very great facilitie, and without any perill, and that we might goe after for <hi>Zoraida.</hi> His opinion liked vs all verie well, and therefore without lingring any longer, he leading the way we came to the vessell, and he himselfe leaping in first of all set hand to his faulchion and said, in <hi>Morisco</hi> let none of you that is, heere stirre himselfe, if he loue his life. And saying so all the rest of the <hi>Christians</hi> entred: the <hi>Moores</hi> which were of little spirit, hearing their master say so, were maruellously amazed, and without daring, any one of them to set hand to their armes, which were but a few at all, they suffered themselues very quietly to be taken and bound
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:173111:245"/> by the <hi>Christians,</hi> which did it very dexteriously, threatning them that if they did let slip the least outcry, they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be all put to the sword: this being finished, and the halfe of our people remaining in their guard, wee that were left, conducted also by the renegate, went towards <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moratus</hi> garden, the doore thereof did, by very good hap, open with as little noise as if it it had had no locke at all: Whereupon we went with great quietnesse and silence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the house vnfelt or espied of any.</p>
               <p>The beautifull <hi>Zoraida</hi> was the while expecting vs at a window, and as soone as she felt people approach, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a low voice whether we were <hi>Nizarans,</hi> as if she would say or aske, whether we were <hi>Christians?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that we were, and willed her to come downe. As soone as she knew mee, she stayed not a minute, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out answering any word, came downe in an instant; and opening the doore, shewed her selfe to vs all more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and richly attired, then I am able in any sort to expresse. As soone as I saw her, I tooke her by the hand, and kissed it, the same did the renegate, and my two <hi>Camaradas;</hi> and all the rest which knew not the matter, did as they had seene vs doe before them; for it seemed that wee did no more but giue her thankes, and acknowledge her the auctresse of all our liberties. The renegat demaunded of her in her owne language, whether her father were in the garden or no? she answered that he was, &amp; that he slept; then wil it be requisite quoth the renegat, to rouse him, &amp; beare him, &amp; al the other things of worth in this garden away with vs: that shal not be so, (quooth she, for I will haue no man to touch my father, and in this house there is nothing of value, but that which I meane to carry away with my selfe, which is so much as will be sufficient to cheere and inrich you all: as if you will stay but a while, you shall perceiue. And saying so, she entred againe into the house, promising to returne to vs speedily, and bade vs stand still without making any noise. I deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the renegate what speech had passed betweene them,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:173111:245"/> and he told me all she had said, and I answered him againe that I would not haue <hi>Zoraidas</hi> will transgrest in any sort: by this time she returned loden with a little Casket full of gold, so that she was scarce able to beare it. And her father in the meane season, by bad fortune awaked, and heard the noyse that was beneath in his garden, and looking out at a window he perceiued that they were all <hi>Christians</hi> that were in it, &amp; therfore cried out in a loud and vnmeasurable maner in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, <hi>Christians, Christians, Theeues, Theeues;</hi> by which cries we were all of vs strucken into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great feare and confusion: but the renegate seeing the perill wherein we were, and how neerely it concerned him to come off from that enterprize, before he were discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ranne vp very speedily to the place where <hi>Aquimorato</hi> stood, and some of our fellowes accompanied him (for I durst not abandon <hi>Zoraida,</hi> who had falne betweene mine armes all amazed) and in conclusion those which had moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted behaued themselues so well, as they brought <hi>Aquimora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> downe in a trice, hauing tied his hand, and set a gagge in his mouth, which hindred his speech, threatning him that if hee did speake but a word, it should cost him his life.</p>
               <p>When his daughter saw him, she couered her eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she would not behold him, and he maruelled, wholy ignoring with how good a will she came away with vs: but then considering that nothing was so requisite as our legges, we did with al velocity &amp; diligence get into the frigat, for our companions did perplexedly expect our returne, halfe afraid that some disgrace had befalne vs. Scarse were two houres of the night ouerrunne when we were all imbarked: and then we vnmanacled <hi>Zoraidas</hi> fathers hands, and tooke the cloath out of his mouth. But the renegate did againe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him, that as he tendred his life he should not speake one word, he beholding his daughter likewise there, beganne to sigh very feelingly, but chiefly perceiuing me to hold her so straightly embraced, and that she made no resistance, nor
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:173111:246"/> did complaine or seeme coy, but stood quiet. But yet for all that he kept silence, fearing lest they should put the rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates menaces in execution. <hi>Zoraida</hi> seeing her selfe now safe within the Barke, and that we were readie to row away, looking on her father, and the other <hi>Moores</hi> that were tied therein, she intreated the renegate to tell me how she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to doe her the fauour to set those <hi>Moores</hi> and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at liberty, for she would rather cast her selfe into the Sea then see a father, who had loued her so dearely, caried away captiue before her eyes, and that also by her occasion. The renegate told me her minde, and I answered how I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleased it should be so: but he replied, that it was in no sort expedient, by reason that if they were landed there, they would presently raise the countrey, and put the whole Citie into a tumult, and cause certaine light Frigats to bee manned, and sent out in our pursuite; and lay both Sea and land for vs in such sort as it would be impossible for vs to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: but that as might bee done was to giue them liberty at the first <hi>Christian</hi> countrey whereat we arriued: All of vs agreed to this opinion, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> also (to whom reason was giuen of the motiues we had not to free them forthwith and accomplish her will therein) remained satisfied: and therefore presently with ioyfull silence, and cheerefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence euery one of our lustie rowers, ceasing vpon his oare, we beganne, after we had commended our selues vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to lanch forth, and addresse our course towards the Iles of <hi>Mallorca,</hi> which is the neerest <hi>Christian</hi> country: but by reason that the wind blew somwhat from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and that the Sea began to be rough, it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to continue that course; and so wee were forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the shore, &amp; go by little and little towards <hi>Oran,</hi> not without great griefe and anguish, for feare to be espied by the towne of <hi>Sargell,</hi> vvhich is on that cost, and falles some seuentie leagues beyond <hi>Argiers:</hi> and vve did likewise feare to meete in that passage some galleat of those vvhich come ordinarily vvith merchandize from <hi>Tetuan,</hi> although euerie
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:173111:246"/> one of vs for himself, &amp; for altogether, did presume, that if we encountred a galliot of merchandize, so it were not a Pirate, that not only we wold not be lost, but rather would take the vessell that therein we might with more security finish our voyage. <hi>Zoraida</hi> whilst thus we sailed, went with her head between my hands, because she would not looke on her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I felt her, how she was still inuoking of <hi>Lela Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien</hi> to assist vs, and hauing sailed about some thirty leagues, the morning ouertook vs about some three Musket shot frō land, in a place that seemed to be desart, and free from all accesse of those that might discouer vs; and yet for all that, we got by might and maine, somewhat further into the Seas, that now were become a little calmer, and hauing entred some two leagues into the maine, order was giuen, that they should row by turnes, whilst they did refresh themselues and take a little sustenance, for the Barke was very well furnished with victuals, although those which did rowe, refused the offer saying, that then it was no time to repose, and that they should set those that did not row to dinner, for they would not yet in in any sort let go their Oates. It being done as they had said, the wind did rise so much as it made vs aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our Oares, to set saile and direct our Boat towards <hi>Oran,</hi> being vnable to take any other course: all was done with very great speed, &amp; so we made by the saile more then eight miles an hower, free from all other feare, then that of encountring some vessell of war. We gaue the <hi>Moores</hi> our prisoners their dinner, and the renegate conforted them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they went not as prisoners, for they should receiue their liberty, vpon the first commodity that were proferd. The same was likewise said to <hi>Zoraidas</hi> father, who returned them this answere. I would easily expect and beleeue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing O <hi>Christians</hi> of your liberality &amp; honorable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, but do not thinke that I am so simple as once to imagine that you will giue me my liberty, for you did neuer, expose your selfe to the danger of dispoiling me thereof, with intention to returne it me so prodigally againe,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:173111:247"/> especially knowing as you do, who I am, and the profit which you may reape by giuing me it againe, to which profit if you wil put a name, &amp; tel me how much would you demand, I do euen from hence offer vnto you all that which you will seeke for me, &amp; for that vnfortunate daughter of mine, or if you wil not deliuer me, I will giue you it for her alone, who is the greatest, &amp; the best part of my soule. And saying so, he began to weep so bitrerly, as he moued vs all to cōpassion, &amp; forced <hi>Zoraida</hi> to looke vpon him; who seeing him weepe, was so strangely moued as arising frō my feet, she went &amp; embraced her father, and laying her face vpon his, they began together so tender a lamentation, as many of vs that were in the Bark were forced to keep thee cōpany: but when her father noted her to be so richly adorned, &amp; with so many Iewels on, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her in his own language, how haps this daughter that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternight late before this terrible disaster befel vs, wherin we are plunged, I saw thee attired in thine ordinary houshold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, &amp; that now without hauing had any leasure to apparrel thy self, or hauing giuē thee any glad tidings, for whose solēnizing, thou oughtest to adorne &amp; publish thy selfe, I do view thee thus clad in the richest attire which I could bestow vpon thee, when our fortune was most fauourable. Answer me to this, for thou hast suspended and astonished mee more then the very disgrace it selfe wherein I am.</p>
               <p>All that the <hi>Moore</hi> said to his daughter the renegate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs, and she did not answere a word to him: but when he saw the little coffers lie at one side of the Barke, wherein she was wont to keepe her Iewels, and that hee knew very well she had left at <hi>Argiers,</hi> and not brought to the garden, he was much more amazed, and demaunded of her how that coffer was come into our possession, and what things she had therewith in it? to which the renegate without attending that <hi>Zoraida</hi> should answere him, said, Sir do not trouble your selfe by demaunding so many things of your daughter <hi>Zoraida,</hi> for with one that I will say, I shal sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them all: and therefore you shall vnderstand that shee
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:173111:247"/> is a <hi>Christian,</hi> and hath been the file that cut off our chaines, and is the liberty it selfe of our captiuitie, and she goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with vs of her owne free will, as content (if mine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not wrong me) to see her selfe in this state, as he is that commeth out of darkenesse to the light, from death vnto life, and out of paine into glory. Is it true daughter, which this man sayes, quoth the Moore? It is, answered <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayda:</hi> that thou in effect art a <hi>Christian,</hi> replyed the old man, and she that hath put her father into his enemies hands? To which <hi>Zorayda</hi> answered, I am she that is a <hi>Christiā,</hi> but not she that hath brought thee to this passe: for my desire did neuer so estrange it selfe from thee, as to abandon or harme thee, but only endeuored to do my self good. And what good hast thou done thy self daughter? demand that, said she of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Marien,</hi> for she can therin informe thee better then I can.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the Moore heard her say so, when with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible haste he threw himselfe headlong into the Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had beene questionlesly drowned, if the long appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell he wore on, had not kept him vp a while aboue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Zoraida</hi> cried out to vs to saue him, and so we all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently ranne, and laying hold on a part of his Turkish robe, drew him vp halfe drowned, and wholly deuoyde of feeling. Whereat <hi>Zorayda</hi> was so grieued, that she lamented him as dolefully as if he had beene dead. There we laid him with his mouth downward, and he auoyded a great quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after the space of two houres returned to himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and in the meane time the winde also turning, it did driue vs towards the coast; so that we were constrayned to keepe ourselues by very force of armes from striking vpon it, and our good fortune directing vs, we arriued to a little creeke at the side of a certaine Cape or Promontory, called by the <hi>Moores</hi> the Cape of the <hi>Caua Rumia,</hi> which in our language signifies <hi>the ill Christian woman:</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> hold it for a tradition, that in the very same place was the <hi>Caua</hi> buried, for whom Spaine was lost, and conquered by the <hi>Moores:</hi> for <hi>Caua</hi> in their language signifies <hi>an illwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:173111:248"/> and <hi>Rumia</hi> a <hi>Christian:</hi> yea, and they holde it for a signe of misfortune to arriue or cast Ancre there, when meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity driues them thither: without which they neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it, yet did it not proue to vs the shelter of an ill wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the secure hauen of our safery. We sent our Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels a shore, and neuer let Oares slip out of our hands: We did likewise eate of the Renegates prouision, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily besought Almightie God and our Ladie to assist and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vs with a happy end, to so luckie a beginning. And we agreed vpon <hi>Zoraydas</hi> intreatie, to set her father and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moores that we had tied, a land in that place: for she was of so tender and compassionate a minde, as she could in no wise brooke to see her father tied in her presence, or her countreymen borne away captiues: wherfore we made her a promise that we wold at our departure let them al go away, seeing we incurd no danger by leauing them in that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table desart: our prayers were not so vain, but that they found gentle acceptance in heauen, which presently changed the winde and appeased the Sea, inuiting vs cheerfully to returne to it againe, and prosecute our commenced voyage.</p>
               <p>Seeing that the weather was fauourable, we loosed the <hi>Moors,</hi> &amp; set them al a land one by one; and comming to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mbark <hi>Zoraydas</hi> father, who was by that time wholly come to himselfe, he said, For what doe you coniecture <hi>Christians,</hi> that this bad woman is glad that you giue me libertie? Do you thinke that she doth it for pitie that she takes of me? No truely, but she doth it onely to remoue the hinderance my presence gaue her when she would execute her vnlawful desires. Nor ought you to beleeue that shee is moued to change religion, by reason that she vnderstands yours to be better then her owne, but onely because she knowes licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to be more publickely and freely practised in your countrey then among vs: &amp; then turning to <hi>Zorayda,</hi> whom I and another Christian held fast by both the armes lest shee should do some desperate acte, he said, O infamous girle, and il-aduised mayden, where dost thou runne thus blinded and
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:173111:248"/> distracted, in the power of those dogges our naturall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Cursed be the houre wherein I engendred thee, and cursed the delights and pleasures wherin thou wast nousled. I perceiuing that he was not like to make an end of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations so soone as I could wish, had him set on shore, and thence he prosecuted his maledictions, and plaints praying vnto <hi>Mahomet</hi> that he would intercede with <hi>Alà,</hi> that we might be all destroyed, confounded, &amp; cast away. And when we could heare his words no longer, by reason that we set saile, we perceiued his works, that were, to plucke his beard, teare his haire, and cast himselfe on the ground: but once he did lift vp his voyce so high, as that we heard him say, return beloued daughter, returne to the land, for I doe pardon thee all that thou hast done, and deliuer that money to those men, for it is now their owne, and returne thou to comfort thy sadde and desolate father, who will forsake his life on these desolate sands, if thou dost abandon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zorayda</hi> heard him say all this, and lamented thereat, but knew not how to speake, or answere him any other thing but this, Father mine, I pray <hi>Alà</hi> that <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> who hath beene the cause of my becomming a <hi>Christian,</hi> may likewise comfort thee in thy sorrow. <hi>Alà</hi> knowes well that I could do none other then I did, &amp; that these <hi>Christians</hi> do owe me nothing for my good wil, seeing that though I had not come away with them, but remained at my house, yet had it beene impossible (such was the hast wherewithall my soule pressed me) not to haue executed this my purpose, which seemes to me to be as good, as thou O beloued father, dost account it wicked. She said this in a time that neither her father could heare her, nor we beholde him: and therefore after I had comforted <hi>Zorayda,</hi> we did thenceforth onely attend our voyage, which was so much holpen by the fauorable winde, as we made full account to bee the next day on the cost of Spaine: but as good very seldome or rather neuer, betides a man thoroughly and wholly, without being accompanied or followed by some euill which troubles and assaults it, our
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:173111:249"/> fortune would, or rather the maledictions of the <hi>Moore</hi> powred on his daughter: (for the curses of any father what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer are to bee feared) that being ingulfed three houres within night, and going before the winde with a full sayle, and our Oares set vp, because the prosperous winde had rid vs of the labour of rowing: we saw neere vnto vs, by the light of the Moone that shined very cleerely, a round vessel, which with all her sailes spread, did crosse before vs in the Sea, and that so neerely as we were faine to strike down her saile, that we might auoide the shog she was like to giue vs; and those that were in her had on the other side laboured also what they might, to turne her out of our way, standing all of them on the hatches to demaund of vs what we were, from whence we came, and whither vve did saile? But by reason that they spake French, the Renegate bad vs not to speake a word, saying, Let none answer, for these are French Pirates which make their bootie of euery body. For this cause none of vs answered: and being passed a litle forward, and that the Ship remained in the Lee of vs, they suddenly shotte off two pieces of Artillery, and as I thinke both of them had chaine bullets, for with the one they cut our Mast asunder, and ouerthrew it and the saile into the sea, and instantly after they discharged another, and the bullet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in our barke did pierce it thorow and thorow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any other hurt, but we, seeing that our vessell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to sinke, beganne all to crie out, and request them to succour vs, and prayed them that they would take vs into their vessell, for we were a drowning. Then they amaine, and casting out their Cocke-boate, there entred into it as good as a douzen Frenchmen, wel appointed with their Harcabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and Matches lighted, and so approched vnto vs; and perceiuing how few we were, and that the Barke did sinke, they receiued vs into their boate, saying that because we had vsed the discourtesie of not making them answere, that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had befalne vs. Our Renegate about this time tooke the coffin wherein <hi>Zoraydas</hi> treasures were kept, and threw it into the sea vnperceiued of any.</p>

               <p>In conclusion, we went all of vs into the great vessel with the Frenchmen, who after they had informed themselues of all that which they desired to know, as if they were our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall enemies, they afterward dispoyled vs of all that euer we had about vs, and of <hi>Zorayda</hi> they tooke all, euen vnto her very bracelets, that she wore on the wrests of her feete. But the wrong they did to <hi>Zorayda</hi> did not afflict mee so much as the feare I conceiued, that after they had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her, her most rich and pretious jewels, they would also depriue her of the jewell of most price, and which shee valued most. But the desires of that nation extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no farther, then to the gaine of money: and their aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice in this is neuer throughly satisfied; and at that time was so great, as they would haue taken from vs the very habites of slaues, that we brought from <hi>Barbarie,</hi> if they had found them to haue beene worth anything: and some there were of opinion among them, that we should be al inwreathed in a saile, and throwen into the Sea, because they had intention to traffique into some hauens of <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Britaines,</hi> and that if they caried vs aliue, they should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, their robery being detected: but the Captaine, who was he that had pilled my beloued <hi>Zorayda,</hi> said, that hee was so contented with his booty, as he meaned not to touch any part of Spaine, but would passe the streights of <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> by night, or as he might, and so returne againe to <hi>Rochel,</hi> from whence he was come: and there vp on they all agreed to giue vs their Cock-boate, and all that was necessary for our short voyage, as indeed they performed the day ensuing when we were in the view of Spaine, with the sight whereof all our griefes and pouerties were as quite forgotten as if we neuer had felt any; so great is the delight a man takes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his liberty. It was about midday when they put vs into the Cocke, giuing vnto vs two Barrels of water and some Bisket; and the Captaine moued with some compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the beautifull <hi>Zorayda</hi> embarqued her selfe, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her about fortie crownes in gold; nor would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:173111:250"/> his Souldiers to dispoyle her of these very garments, which then and now she weares.</p>
               <p>We entred into the cockboate, and giuing them thankes for the good they did, and shewing at our departure more tokens of thankfulnes, then of discontent; they sailed present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away from vs towards the straights, and we without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on any other north or starre, then the land it self which appeared before vs, did row towards it so lustily, that at the Sunneset we were so neare, as we made full account to arriue before the night were farre spent. But by reason that the Moone did not shine, and the night was very darke, and that wee knew not where wee were, wee did not hold it the best course to approch the shore too neare; yet others there were that thought it conuenient and good, desiring that wee should make to it, although we ran the boate on the rocks, and farre from any dwelling; for by doing so, we should free our selues from the feare which we ought of reason to haue, lest there should bee vp and downe on that coast any Frigats of the Pyrates of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> which are wont to leaue <hi>Barbarie</hi> ouer night, and be on the coast of <hi>Spaine</hi> ere morning, and ordinarily make their booty and turne to their supper againe to <hi>Barbarie</hi> the night following: but of the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that which was followed was, that wee should draw neare the land by little and little, and that if the quietnesse of the Sea would permit it, wee should take land where wee might best and most commodiously doe it. This was done, and a little before midnight we arriued to the foot of a high and monstrous mountaine, which was not altogether so neare to the Sea, but that it did grant a litle patch of ground, whereon we might commodiously disembarke. Wherefore we ranne our selues on the sands, and came all a land and kissed the earth, and with teares of most ioyfull content and delight, gaue thankes vnto our Lord God, for the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fauours which hee had done vs in our voyage: then tooke we out our vittailes from the boate, and drew it selfe vp on the shore, and ascended a great part of the mountaine,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:173111:250"/> for although we were in that place, yet durst wee not asture our selues, nor did throughly beleeue that it was a <hi>Christian</hi> Country whereon we did treade.</p>
               <p>The day breaking somewhat slower then I could haue wished it; we ascended the mountaine wholly, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we might discouer any dwelling, or sheepfoulds from thence; but although wee extended our sight vnto euery quarter, yet could we neither descry dwelling, person, path, nor high way: yet did we resolue notwithstanding to enter into the land, seeing that wee could not choose but discouer ere long some body who might giue vs notice of the place where we were: and that which afflicted me most of all was, to see <hi>Zoraida</hi> goe a foote through those rugged places; for although I did sometimes carry her on my shoulders, yet did the toile I tooke more weary her, then the repose shee got could ease her; and therefore would neuer after the first time suffer me to take that paines againe, and so shee went euer after a foot with great patience, and tokens of ioy, I holding her still by the hand; and hauing trauailed little lesse then a quarter of a league, we heard the noise of a little bell, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible argument that neare at hand there was some cattle; whereupon all of vs looking very wistly to see whether any body appeared, wee might perceiue vnder a Corke-tree a young sheep-heard, who very quietly and carelesly was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of a sticke with a knife: we called to him, and he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp lightly on foote, and (as we afterwards learned) the first that he got sight of, were the renegate and <hi>Zoraida</hi> whom he seeing apparelled in the <hi>Morisco</hi> habit, thought that all the people of <hi>Barbarie</hi> had been at his heeles, and therefore running very swiftly into the wood, he cryed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with maruailous lowdnesse, <hi>Moores, Moores,</hi> are in the land; <hi>Moores, Moores,</hi> arme, arme. These outcryes strucke vs a new into a great perplexity, and scarce did wee know what vve should doe: but considering how the sheep-heards alarme would cause all the Country to rise vp, and that the horsemen that kept the coast would presently come to see
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:173111:251"/> vvhat it was; we all agreed that the renegate should put off his <hi>Turkish</hi> attyre, and put on a captiues caffocke, which one of the company gaue vnto him forthwith, although the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remained after in his shirt, and thus committing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire vnto almighty God, we followed on by the same way, which we saw the sheep-heard had taken, alwaies expecting when the horsemen of the coast would fall vpon vs, and we were not deceiued in our expectation, for within two houres after, hauing issued out of those woods into a plaine, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered about some fifty horsemen which came running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs as swiftly as their horses could driue, and hauing perceiued them we stood still, and stayed vntill they came to vs, and saw, in steed of the <hi>Moores,</hi> they sought for, so many poore <hi>Christians,</hi> and remayned somewhat ashamed thereat: and one of them demaunded whether we were the occasion that a sheep-heard had giuen the alarme: yes, quoth I, and as I was about to informe what I was, and of all our aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from whence we came; one of the <hi>Christians</hi> that came with vs, did take notice of the horseman who had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto vs, and so interrupting my speech, he said. Sirs let God be praised which hath brought vs to so good a place as this is, for if I be not deceiued the earth which we treade is of <hi>Veley Malaga;</hi> and if the yeares of my captiuity haue not confounded my memory, you likewise Sir that demaunds vvhat we be, are <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bustamonte,</hi> mine Vncle. As soone as euer the <hi>Christian</hi> captiue had spoken those wordes, the horseman leaping of his horse ranne and embraced him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O nephew as deare to me as my soule and life, now I doe know thee very well, and many a day since haue I wept for thee, thinking thou vvast dead, and so hath my sister thy mother, and all the rest of thy friends which doe liue yet, and God hath been pleased to preserue their liues, that they may inioy the pleasure to behold thee. We knew very vvell that thou vvast in <hi>Argiers,</hi> and by the signes and tokens of thy clothes, and that of all the rest here of thy companions, I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that your escape hath beene miraculous: it was so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:173111:251"/> the Captiue, and vve shall haue time, I hope, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto you the manner.</p>
               <p>As soone as the horsemen had vnderstood, that vve vvere <hi>Christian</hi> captiues, they allighted of their horses, and euery one of them inuited vs to mount vpon his owne, to carry vs to the Citty of <hi>Ʋeley Malaga,</hi> vvhich vvas yet a league and a halfe from that place, and some of them vvent to the place vvhere vve had left the boate, to bring it to the Citty; whom vve informed first of the place where it lay; others did mount vs vp a horsebacke behind themselues, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the captiues Vncle: all the people issued to receiue vs being premonished of our arriuall by some one that had rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before. They did not wonder to see Captiues freed, nor <hi>Moores</hi> captiued there, being an ordinary thing in those parts, but that whereat they wondred, was the surpassing beauty of <hi>Zoraida,</hi> which at that season and instant vvas in her prime, as vvell through the warmth shee had gotten by her trauaile, as also through the ioy she conceiued to see her selfe in <hi>Christian</hi> lands, secure from all feare of being surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or lost: and these things called out to her face such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as if it be not that affection might then haue deceiued mee, I durst auer, that a more beautifull then shee was, the world could not affoord, at least among those which I had euer beheld.</p>
               <p>We went directly to the Church to giue thanks vnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for the benefit receiued, and as soone as <hi>Zorai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> entred into it, shee said there were faces in it, that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled very much that of <hi>Lela Marien:</hi> we told her that they were her images, and the renegate as well as the breuitie of the time permitted, instructed her what they signified, to the end shee should doe them reuerence, as if euery one of them were truly that same <hi>Lela Marien,</hi> which had spoken vnto her. She who hath a very good vnderstanding, and an easie and cleare conceit, comprehended presently all that was told vnto her concerning Images: from thence they carryed vs, and deuided vs among different houses of the Citty, but the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:173111:252"/>
                  <hi>Christian</hi> that came with vs carryed the Renegate, <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and me to the house of his parents, which were indifferently accommodated, and stored with the goods of Fortune, and did entertaine me with as great loue and kindnesse, as if I were their owne sonne. We remayned sixe dayes in <hi>Veley,</hi> in which time the renegate hauing made an information of all that which might concerne him, hee went to the Citty of <hi>Granada</hi> to be reconciled, by the holy <hi>Inquisitions</hi> meanes, to the bosome of our holy Mother the Church. The rest of the freed captiues tooke euery one the way that he pleased, and <hi>Zoraida</hi> and I remained behinde, with those Duckats only which the Frenchmans curtesie was pleased to bestow on <hi>Zoraida,</hi> and with part of that summe I bought her this beast whereon shee rides: I my selfe seruing her hitherto as her Father and her Squire, and not as her Spouse, we trauaile with intention to see whether my father be yet liuing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my brothers haue had more prosperous hap then my selfe, although seeing that heauen hath made mee <hi>Zoraidas</hi> consort, mee thinkes no other good Fortune could arriue were it neuer so great, that I would hold in so high estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The patience wherewithall shee beares the incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities vsually annext vnto pouerty, and the desires shee shewes to become a <hi>Christian,</hi> is such and so great, as it strikes mee into an admiration, and doth moue mee to serue her all the dayes of my life: although that the delight which I take to see my selfe hers, and shee mine, is oftimes interrupted and almost dissolued by the feare which I haue, that I shall not finde in mine owne Countrey some little corner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may entertayne her; and that time and death haue wrought such alteration in the goods and liues of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and brothers, as I shall scarce finde any one at home that knowes mee. I haue no more good Sirs, to tell you of my liues Historie, then which whether it be pleasing, and rare, or no, your cleare conceipts are to iudge: as for my selfe I dare say, that if it had beene possible, I would haue told it with more breuitie; fearing it might bee tedious
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:173111:252"/> vnto you, I purposely omitted many delightfull circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereof.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Captiue hauing said this, held his peace, and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> replyed to him thus. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Captaine, the manner wherewithall you haue recounted this maruailous successe hath beene such, as it may be parrangond to the nouelty and strangenesse of the euent it self, and so great is the delight we haue taken in the hearing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I doe beleeue, that although wee had spent the time from hence till to morrow in listning to it, yet should we be glad to heare it told ouer once againe, &amp; saying so, <hi>Cardenio,</hi> and all the rest did offer themselues and their meanes to his seruice as much as lay in them with so cordiall and friendly words, as the Captaine remained throughly satisfied with their good wits: but specially <hi>Don Fernando</hi> offered, that if hee would returne with him hee would cause the <hi>Marquesse</hi> his brother to be <hi>Zoraida</hi> her Godfather in Baptisme, and that hee for his part, would so accommodate him with all things necessary, as he might enter into the towne, with the decency and authority due to his person. The Captiue did gratifie his large offers very curteously, but would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any of them at that time: by this the night drew on, and about the fall thereof, there arriued at the Inne a coatch with some men a horsebacke, and asked for lodging: to whom the Hostesse answered, that in all the Inne there was not a spanne free. The number of her guests was already so many: well, although that be so, quoth one of the horsemen that had entred, yet must there be a place found for Master
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:173111:253"/>
                  <hi>Iustice,</hi> who comes in this Coach. At this name, the Hostesse was affraid, and said, Sir the misfortune is, that I haue no beds, but if Master <hi>Iustice</hi> brings one with him, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he doth, let him enter in boldly, and I and my husband will leaue our owne chamber to accommodate his worship. So be it, quoth the Squire, and by this time allighted out of the Coach, a man whose attyre did presently denote his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and office; for his long gowne and his great and large sleeues did shew that he was a Iudge, as the Seruingman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. He led a young maiden by the hand, of about some sixteene yeares old, apparelled in riding attyre, but she was therewithall of so disposed, beautifull, and chearfull a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as her presence did strike them all into admiration: so as if they had not seene <hi>Dorotea, Luscinda,</hi> and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> which were then in the Inne, they would hardly haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that this Damzels beauty might any where haue beene matched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was present at the Iudges, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans entry, and so, as soone as he had seene him, he said, Sir you may boldly enter, and take your ease in this Castle, which although it be but little, and ill accommodated, yet there is no narrownesse nor discommodity in the world, but makes place for armes, and learning, and specially if the armes and letters bring beauty for their guide and leader, as your learning doth, conducted by this louely Damzell, to whom ought not only Castles to open and manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but also rocks to part and deuide their cliffes, and mountaines to bow their ambitious crests, to giue and make her a lodging. Enter therefore, I say, Worshipfull Sir, into this Paradise, wherein you shall finde Starres and Sunnes, to accompany this skie which you bring in your company. Here shall you find armes in their height, and beauty in her prime. The Iudge maruailed greatly at <hi>Don-Quixots</hi> speech, whom he began to behold very earnestly, and wondered no lesse at his shape then at his words, and knowing not what answere he might returne him, he was diuerted on the other side, by
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:173111:253"/> the suddaine approch of the three Ladies <hi>Luscinda, Dorotea,</hi> and <hi>Zoraida,</hi> which stood before him, for hauing heard of the arriuall of new guests, and also being informed by the Hostesse of the young Ladies beauty, they were come forth to see, and entertaine her. But <hi>Don Fernando, Cardenio,</hi> and the <hi>Curate,</hi> did giue him more compleate and courtly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment then the rusty Knight. In effect the Iudge was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously amazed at that which hee sawe and heard in that Inne; and the faire guests thereof, bad the beautifull maiden welcome. The Iudge perceiued very well, that the guests of the Inne were all men of account, but <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> feature visage, and behauiour, did set him out of all byas, being not able to coniecture what he might be: and after some court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like intercourses passed, and the commodities of the Inne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, they all agreed againe, as they had done before, that all the women should enter into <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> roome, and the men remaine without in their guarde. And so the Iudge was content that the Damzel, who was his daughter, should also goe with those Ladies, which shee did with a very good will: and with a part of the Inkeepers narrow bed, and halfe of that which the Iudge had brought with him, they made shift to passe ouer that night the best they could.</p>
               <p>The Captiue, who from the instant that he had first seene the Iudge, did greatly suspect that he was his brother, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of one of his seruants, how he was called, &amp; where he was borne. The other answered, how he was called the <hi>Licenciat Iohn Perez of Ʋiedma,</hi> and as hee had heard, hee was borne in a Village of the mountaines of <hi>Leon.</hi> With this relation and the rest that he had noted, he finally confirmed his opinion that it was the brother, who following his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aduice, had dedicated himselfe to his studies, and full of ioy and contentment, calling a side <hi>Don Fernando, Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> and the <hi>Curate,</hi> he certified them of all that passed, and that the Iudge was his brother. The seruingman told him likewise how he went towards the <hi>Indies,</hi> where he had his place and office in the Courts of <hi>Mexico:</hi> and also that the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:173111:254"/> young Gentlewoman was his daughter, of whose birth her mother had died, and he euer after remained a widdower, and very rich, by her dowry and portion that shee had left to her daughter: he demanded of them aduice how he might discouer himselfe to his brother, or first know, whether after he had detected himselfe, he would receiue him with a good countenance and affection, and not be ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for his brother, seeing him in so poore an estate: leaue the triall of that experience to mee, quoth the <hi>Curate,</hi> and the rather because there is no occasion why you Sir Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine should not be kindly entertained by him: for the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, worths, and good countenance of your brother, giue manifest tokens that he is nothing arrogant. For all that said the Captaine, I would not make my selfe knowen on the suddaine, but would vse some pretty ambages to bring him acquainted with me: I say vnto you, quoth the <hi>Curate,</hi> that I will trace the matter in such sort, as we all wil rest satisfied.</p>
               <p>Supper was by this made ready, and all of them sate down to the table, the Captiue excepted and Ladies, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together within the roome: and about the midst of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the <hi>Curate</hi> said, Master Iustice, I haue had in times past a <hi>Comrades</hi> of your very surname in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where I was sometime Captiue, who was one of the most valiant Souldiers and Captaines that might be found among all the <hi>Spanish</hi> foote: but he was as vnfortunate as he was valorous and resolute. And how was that Captaine called good Sir, quoth the Iudge? his name was, replyed Master <hi>Curate, Ruy Perez of Viedma,</hi> and he was borne in a Village of the mountaines of <hi>Leon;</hi> and he recounted vnto me an occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hapned betweene his father, him, and his other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which if I had not beene told by a man of such credit and reputation as he was, I would haue esteemed for one of these fables which old Wiues are wont to rehearse by the fire side in winter: for hee said to me that his father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided his goods among his three sons, and gaue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all certaine precepts, better then those of <hi>Cato;</hi> and I know
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:173111:254"/> well, that the choise which he made to follow the warre, had such happy successe, as within a few yeares, through his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse and valour, without the helpe of any other arme, he was aduanced to a company of foot, and made a Captain, and was in the way and course of becomming one day a Collonell, but fortune was contrary to him, for euen there, where he was most to expect her fauour, he lost it, with the losse of his liberty, in that most happy iourney wherein so many recouered it, to wit, in the battell of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> I lost mine in <hi>Goleta,</hi> and after by different successe wee became companions in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from whence we went to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> where did befall him one of the most notable aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that euer hapned in the world; and there the Curate with succinct breuity recounted all that had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Captaine and <hi>Zorayda:</hi> to all which the Iudge was so attentiue, as in all his life he neuer listned to any cause so attentiuely, as then. And the <hi>Curate</hi> onely arriued to the point wherein the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> spoiled the <hi>Christians</hi> that came in the Barke, and the necessity wherein his companion and the beautifull <hi>Zorayda</hi> remained: of whom he had not learned any thing after, nor knew not what became of them or whether they came into Spaine, or were caried away by the Frenchmen to Fraunce.</p>
               <p>The Captaine stood listening somewhat a loose off to all the <hi>Curates</hi> wordes, and noted the while the motions and gestures of his brother; who seeing that the <hi>Curate</hi> had now made an end of his speech, breathing forth a great sigh, and his eyes being filled with teares, he said: O Sir, if you had known the newes which you haue told me, and how neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they touch me in some points, whereby I am constrained to manifest these teares which violently breake forth in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of my discretion, and calling, you would hold me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for this excesse. That Captaine of whom you spoke, is my eldest brother, who, as one stronger, and of more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts then I or my younger brother, made election of the honourable military calling; one of the three estates
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:173111:255"/> which our father proposed to vs, euen as your <hi>Comrade</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you, when as you thought he related a fable. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my booke, by which God and my diligence raised me to the state you see: my younger brother is in <hi>Peru,</hi> and with that which he hath sent to my father and my selfe, hath bountifully recompenced the portion he caried, and giuen to him sufficient to satisfie his liberall disposition, and to me, wherewithall to continue my studies, with the decensie and authority needfull to aduance me to the ranke which now I possesse. My father liues yet, but dying through desire to learne somewhat of his eldest sonne, and doth daily impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune God with incessant prayers, that death may not shut his eyes vntill he may once againe see him aliue. I only maruell not a little, considering his discretion, that among all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, afflictions, or prosperous successes, he hath beene so carelesse in giuing his father notice of his proceedings: for if eyther he, or any one of vs had knowne of his captiuity, he should not haue needed to expect the miracle of the Cane for his ransome. But that which troubles me most of all, is, to thinke whether these Frenchmen haue restored him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to libertie, or else slaine him, that they might conceale their robberie the better: all which will be an occasion to me to prosecute my voyage, not with the ioy wherewithall I beganne it, but rather with melancholy and sorrow. O deere brother, I would I might know now where thou art, that I my selfe might goe and search thee out, and free thee from thy paines, although it were with the hazard of mine owne. O who is he that could carrie newes to our olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou wert but aliue, although thou wert hidden in the most abstruse dungeons of Barbarie; for his riches, my brothers and mine would fetch thee from thence. O beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bountifull <hi>Zorayda,</hi> who might be able to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee for the good thou hast done to my brother? How happy were he that might be present at thy spirituall birth and baptisme, and at thy nuptials, which would be so grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vs all? These and many other such wordes did the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:173111:255"/> Iudge deliuer, so full of compassion for the newes that he had receiued of his brother, as all that heard him kept him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in shewing signes of compassion for his sorrow.</p>
               <p>The Curate therfore perceiuing the happy successe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his designe and the Captaines desire had sorted, would hold the company sad no longer, and therefore arising from the table, and entring into the roome wherin <hi>Zorayda</hi> was, he tooke her by the hand, and after her followed <hi>Luscinda, Dorotea,</hi> and the Iudge his daughter. The Captaine stood still to see what the Curate would doe; who taking him fast by the other hand matched ouer with them both towards the Iudge and the other Gentlemen, &amp; said: Suppresse your teares Master Iustice, and glut your desire with all that good which it may desire, seeing you haue here before you your good brother, and your louing sister in law: this man whom you view here is the Captaine <hi>Ʋiedma,</hi> and this the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Moore, which hath done so much for him. The French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which I told you of, haue reduced them to the pouerty you see, to the end that you may shew the liberality of your noble brest. Then did the Captaine draw neere to embrace his brother, but he held him off a while with his arms, to note whether it was he or no; but when he once knew him, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him so louingly, and with such aboundance of teares, as did attract the like from all the beholders. The wordes that the brothers spoke one to another, or the feeling affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they shewed, can hardly be conceiued, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much lesse written by any one whatsoeuer. There they did briefly recount the one to the other their successes: there did they shevv the true loue and affection of brothers in his prime: there did the Iudge embrace <hi>Zorayda:</hi> there he made her an offer of all that was his: there did hee also cause his daughter to embrace her: there the beautifull <hi>Christian,</hi> and the most beautiful <hi>Moore</hi> renued the teares of them al: there <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was attentiue, without speaking a word, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of these rare occurrences, and attributing them to the <hi>Chimeras,</hi> which he imagined to be incident to Chiualrie:
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:173111:256"/> and there they agreed that the Captaine &amp; <hi>Zorayda</hi> should returne with their brother to <hi>Siuill,</hi> and thence aduise their father of his finding and liberty, that he as well as he might should come to <hi>Siuill</hi> to the baptisme and marriage of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayda,</hi> because the Iudge could not possibly return, or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his iourney, in respect that the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleete was to depart within a moneth from <hi>Siuill</hi> towards <hi>New Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euery one in conclusion, was ioyful &amp; glad at the captiues good successe; and two parts of the night being vvelnigh spent, they all agreed to repose themselues a while. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> offered himselfe to watch and guard the Castle whilst they slept, lest they should be assaulted by some Giant or other miscreant, desirous to robbe the great treasure of beautie that was therein immured and kept. Those that knew him rendred vnto him infinite thankes: and withall informed the Iudge of his extrauagant humour, whereat hee was not a little recreated: onely <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> did fret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they went so slowly to sleepe, and he alone was best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated of them all, by lying downe on his beasts fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, vvhich cost him deerely, as shall be after recounted. The Ladies being vvithdrawne into their chamber, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one laying himselfe downe vvhere best he might, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sallied out of the Inne, to be Centinell of the Castle as he had promised. And a little before day it hapned, that so sweete and tunable a voyce touched the Ladies eares, as it obliged them all to listen vnto it very attentiuely, but chiefly <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who first awaked, &amp; by whose side the yong Gentlevvoman <hi>Donna Clara of Viedma</hi> (for so the Iudges daughter was called) slept. None of them could imagine who it vvas that sung so vvell without the helpe of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument: sometimes it seemed that he sung in the yard, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that it was in the stable: and being thus in suspence <hi>Cardenio</hi> came to the chamber dore, and said, Whosoeuer is not asleepe, let them giue eare, and they shall heare the voice of a Lackey that so chants, as it likewise inchants. Sir, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> vve heare him very vvell: vvith this <hi>Cardenio</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:173111:256"/> and <hi>Dorotea</hi> vsing all the attention possible, heard that his song vvas this following.</p>

               <p>The Singer arriuing to this point of his song, <hi>Dorotea</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that it would not be amisse to let <hi>Donna Clara</hi> heare so excellent a voyce, and therfore she iogged her a little on the one and other side, vntill she had awaked her, and then said, Pardon me childe for thus interrupting your sweete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, seeing I doe it to the end you may ioy, by hearing one
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:173111:257"/> of the best voyces that perhaps you euer heard in your life. <hi>Clara</hi> awaked at the first drowsily, and did not well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what <hi>Dorotea</hi> said, and therefore demaunding of her what she said, she told it her againe; wherupon <hi>Donna Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was also attentiue: but scarce had she heard two verses repeated by the early Musitian, when a maruellous tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inuaded her, euen as if she had then suffered the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous fit of a quartane Ague. Wherefore imbracing <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi> very straightly, she said, Alas deere Ladie, why did you awake me, seeing the greatest hap that fortune could in this instant haue giuen me, was, to haue mine eyes and eares so shut, as I might neither see, nor heare that vnfortunate Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian: what is that you say childe, quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> did you not heare one say that the Musitian is but a horseboy? Hee is no horseboy, quoth <hi>Clara,</hi> but a Lord of many townes; and he that hath such firme possession of my soule, as if hee himselfe will not reiect it, he shall neuer be depriued of the dominion thereof. <hi>Dorotea</hi> greatly wondred at the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wordes of the young gyrle, whereby it seemed to her that she far surpassed the discretion which so tender yeares did promise: and therefore she replied to her, saying, You speake so obscurely Lady <hi>Clara,</hi> as I cannot vnderstand you, expound your selfe more cleerly, and tel me what is that you say of soules, and townes, and of this Musitian, whose voyce hath altred you so much: but doe not say anything to me now; for I would not lose, by listening to your disgusts, the pleasure I take to heare him sing, for me thinkes he resumes his musicke with new verses, and in another tune: in a good houre, quoth <hi>Donna Clara;</hi> and then because shee her selfe would not heare him, she stopt her eares with her fingers; whereat <hi>Dorotea</hi> did also maruell: but being attentiue to the Musicke, she heard the Lackey prosecute his song in this manner.</p>

               <p>Heere the voyce ended, and <hi>Donna Claras</hi> sighes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; all which inflamed <hi>Doroteas</hi> desire to know the cause of so sweete a song, and so sad a plaint. And therefore she eftsoones required her, to tell her now what she was about to haue said before. Then <hi>Clara</hi> timerous, lest <hi>Luscinda</hi> should ouerheare her, imbracing <hi>Dorotea</hi> very neerely, laid her mouth so close to <hi>Doroteas</hi> eare, as she might speake se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely without being vnderstood by any other, and said; he that sings is, deere Ladie, a Gentlemans sonne of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Aragon,</hi> whose father is Lord of two townes, and dwelled right before my fathers house at the Court, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the windowes of our house were in Winter couered with seare cloth, and in Sommer with lattice, I know not
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:173111:258"/> how it happened, but this Gentleman, who went then to the schole espied me, and whether it was at the Church, or else where, I am not certaine. Finally, he fell in loue with mee, and did acquite me with his affection from his owne win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes that were opposite to mine, with so many tokens and such abundance of teares, as I most forceably beleeued, and also affected him, without knowing how much he loued me among the signes that he would make me one was to ioyne the one hand to the other, giuing me thereby to vnderstand that he would marry me: and although I would be very glad that it might be so; yet as one alone, &amp; without a mother, I knew not to whō I might cōmunicate the affaire, &amp; did ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it rest without affording him any other fauour, vnlesse it were when my father &amp; his were gone abroad, by lifting vp the lattice or Searecloth only a little, &amp; permitting him to be hold me; for vvhich fauor he vvould shew such signes of ioy, as a man vvould deeme him to be rest of his vvits. The time of my fathers departure arriuing, &amp; he hering of it, but not from me (for I could neuer tell it to him) he fell sicke, as farre as I could vnderstand for griefe, and therefore I could neuer see him all the day of our departure, to bid him farevvell at least vvith mine eyes: but after me had trauelled tvvo daies iust as vve entred into an Inne in a village a daies iourney from hence, I saw him at the lodging doore, apparrelled so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly like a Lacky, as if I had not borne about me his purtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in my foule, it had bene impossible to know him. I knew him, and wondred, and was glad withall; and he beheld me vnwitting my father, from whose presence he stil hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when he crosses the waies before me as we trauell, or after we arriue at any Inne. And because that I know what he is, and do consider the paine hee takes by comming thus a foote for my sake, and that with so great toyle, I die for sorrow, and where he puts his feete I also put mine eyes. I know not vvith vvhat intention he comes, nor how he could possibly thus escape from his father, vvho loues him beyond measure, both because he hath none other hayre, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:173111:258"/> the young Gentleman also deserues it, as you vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vvhen you see him: and I dare affirme besides, that all that vvhich he saies he composes <hi>extempore,</hi> and vvithout any studie; for I haue heard that he is a fine student, and a great Poet. And euery time that I see him, or do heare him sing, I start and tremble like an Aspen leafe, for feare that my father should know him, and thereby come to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our mutuall affections. I haue neuer spoken one word to him in my life, &amp; yet I do neuerthelesse loue him so much as without him I shall not be able to liue. And this is all, deere Ladie, that I am able to say vnto you of the Musician whose voyce hath pleased you so well, as by it alone you might coniecture, that he is not a horse-boy as you said, but rather a Lord of soules, and townes, as I affirmed.</p>
               <p>Speake no more Ladie <hi>Clara</hi> (quoth <hi>Dorotea,</hi> at that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son kissing her a thousand times:) speake no more I say, but haue patience vntill it be day-light; for I hope in God so to direct your affaires, as that they shall haue the fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that so honest beginning deserue. Alas Madam, quoth <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> what end may be expected, seeing his father is so noble and rich, as he would scarce deeme me worthy to be his sonnes seruant, how much lesse his spouse? and for mee to marry my selfe vnknowne to my father, I would not doe it for all the world. I desire no other thing, but that the young Gentleman would returne home againe, and leaue me alone; perhaps, by not seeing him, and the great distance of the way which we are to trauell, my paine which now so much presseth me, will be somewhat attained, although I dare say, that this remedie which now I haue imagined would auaile me but little: for I know not whence with the vengeance, or by what way this affection which I beare him got into me, seeing both I and he are so young as we be, for I beleeue we are much of an age, and I am not yet full six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene; nor shall be as my father saies, vntil Michaelmas next. <hi>Dorotea</hi> could not contain her laughter, hearing how chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly <hi>Donna Clara</hi> spoke, to whom she said, Lady let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:173111:259"/> againe, and sleepe that little part of the night which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and when God sends day light we will prosper, or my hands shall faile me: with this they held their peace, and all the Inne was drowned in profound silence; only the Inkee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers daughter, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> were not a sleepe, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wel <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> peccant humor, and that he was armed and on horsebacke without the Inne keeping guard, both of them consorted together, and agreed to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way merry with him, or at least to passe ouer some time, in hearing him speake rauingly.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be vnderstood that there was not in all the Inne any window, which looked out into the field, but one hole in a barne, out of which they were wont to cast their straw: to this hole came the two demy-damzels, and saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> mounted and leaning on his Iauelin, and breathing forth, euer and anone, so dolefull and deepe sighes as it seemed his soule was plucked away by euery one of them: and they noted besides how he said with a soft and a morous voice: <hi>O my Ladie Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> the sonne of all beauty, the end and quintessence of discretion, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of sweet countenance and carriage, the storehouse of honesty: and finally the <hi>Idea</hi> of all that which is profitable, modest, or delightfull in the world, and what might thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship be doing at this present? Hast thou perhaps thy mind now vpon thy captiue knight, that most wittingly exposeth himselfe to so many dangers for thy sake, giue vnto me ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of her, O thou Luminary of the three faces, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou dost now with enuy enough behold her, either walking through some gallery of her sumptuous Pallaces, or leaning on some bay window and thinking how (sauing her honour and greatnesse) she shall mitigate, and asswage the torture which this mine oppressed hart indures for her loue, what glory she shall giue for my paines, what quiet to my cares, what life to my death, and what guerdon to my serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And thou sonne, which art as I beleeue, by this time sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thy horses to get away earely, and go out to see my
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:173111:259"/> Mistresse, I request thee as soone as thou shall see her to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her in my behalfe, but beware that when thou lookest on her, and dost greet her, that thou doe not kisse her on the face, for if thou dost I wil become more iealous of thee, then euer thou wast of the swift ingrate which made thee to run and sweat so much through the plaines of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> or the brinks of <hi>Peneo</hi> for I haue forgotten through which of them thou rannest so iealous and inamored. To this point arriued <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whē the Inkeepers daughter began to cal him softly vnto her and say; Sir Knight approach a little hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward if you please. At which voice <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> turned his head and saw by the light of the <hi>Moone</hi> which shined then very clearely, that hee was called too from the hole, which he accounted to be a faire window ful of yron barres, &amp; those costly gylded with gold, well befitting so rich a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle as he imagined that Inne to be, and presently in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he forged to his owne fancie, that once againe as shee had done before, the beautifull Damzell daughter to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of that Castle, ouercome by his loue, did returne to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite him: and with this thought, because he would not shew himselfe discourteous and vngratefull, he turned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanante</hi> about, and came ouer to the hole, and then hauing beheld the two wench hee said: I take pitie on you beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Lady, that you haue placed your amorous thoughts in a place whence it is not possible▪ to haue any correspondence answerable to the desert of your high worth and beauty, whereof you are in no sort to cōdemne this miserable knight errant, whom loue hath wholy dishabled to surrender his will to be any other then to her, whom at the first sight he made absolute mistresse of his soule. Pardon me therefore good Ladie and retire your selfe to your chamber, and make me not, by any further insinuation of your desires, more vnthankfull and discourteous then I would be: and if through the loue that you beare me, you find in me any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wherewethall I may serue and pleasure you, so that it be not loue it selfe, demaund it boldly, for I do sweare
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:173111:260"/> vnto you by mine absence yet sweetest enemy, to bestow it vpon you incontinently, yea though it be a loke of <hi>Medusas</hi> haires, which are all of <hi>Snakes,</hi> or the very Sunne beames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in a violl of glasse.</p>
               <p>My Ladie needes none of those things Sir Knight answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Maritornes:</hi> what doth shee then want discreet Matron, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> only one of your faire hands, said <hi>Maritornes,</hi> that therewithall shee may disburden her selfe of some part of those violent desires, which compelled her to come to this window, with so great danger of her honour; for if her Lord and Father knew of her comming, the least slice he would take of her should bee at the least an eare. I would faine once see that, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but I am sure he will beware how he doe it, if he haue no list to make the most disastrous end that euer father made in this world, for hauing laied violent hands on the delicate limmes of his amorous daughter. <hi>Maritornes</hi> verily perswaded her selfe, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would giue vp his hand as he was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; and hauing already contriued in her minde what shee would doe, descended with all hast from the hole, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the stable, fetched out <hi>Sancho Pancas</hi> his Asses hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and returned againe with very great speede, iust as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (standing vp on <hi>Rozinantes</hi> saddle, that hee might the better reach the barred windowes, whereat he imagined the wounded Damzel remained) did, stretching vp his hand, say vnto her. Hold Lady the hand, or as I may better say, the executioner of earthly miscreants: hold I say that hand, which no other woman euer touched before, not euen shee her selfe that hath intyre possession of my whole body, nor doe I giue it to you, to the end you should kisse it; but that you may behold the contexture of the sinnewes, the knitting of the muscles, and the spaciosity and breadth of the veines, whereby you may collect how great ought the force of that arme to be whereunto such a hand is knit. We shall see that presently, quoth <hi>Maritornes,</hi> and then making a running knot on the halter, shee cast it on the wrest of his hand, and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:173111:260"/> then descending from the hole, shee tyed the other end of the halter very fast to the locke of the barne dore. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> feeling the roughnesse of the halter about his wrest, said: It rather seemes that you grate my hand, then that you cherish it: but yet I pray you, not to handle it so roughly, seeing it is in no fault of the euill which my will doth vnto you: nor is it comly that you should reuenge or disburden the whole bulke of your indignation on so small a part: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that those which loue well, doe not take so cruell reuenge. But no body gaue eare to these wordes of <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> for as soone as <hi>Maritornes</hi> had tyed him, shee and the other almost burst for laughter, ranne away, and left him tyed in such manner, as it was impossible for him to loose himselfe.</p>
               <p>He stood as we haue recounted, on <hi>Rozinante</hi> his saddle, hauing all his arme thrust in at the hole, and fastned by the wrest to the locke: and was in very great doubt and feare, that if <hi>Rozinante</hi> budged neuer so little on any side hee should fall and hang by the arme; and therefore he durst not once vse the least motion of the world, although he might well haue expected from <hi>Rozinantes</hi> patience, and mild spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that if he were suffered, he would stand still a whole age without stirring himselfe. In fine, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing him selfe tyed, and that the Ladies were departed, began straight to imagine that all that had beene done by way of inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the last time, when in the very fame Castle the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <hi>Moore</hi> (the Carrier) had so fairely belaboured him: and then to himselfe did he execrate his own want of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; discourse, seeing that hauing escaped out of that castle so euill dight the first time, he would after aduenture to enter into it the second: for it was generally obserued by Knights errant, that when they had once tried an aduenture, &amp; could not finish it, it was a token that it was not reserued for them, but for some other; and therefore would neuer proue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Yet for all this he drew forward his arme, to see if he might deliuer himselfe; but he was so well bound, as all his
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:173111:261"/> indeauours proued vaine. It is true that he drew it very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, least <hi>Rozinante</hi> should stirre: and although hee would faine haue set, and setled himselfe in the saddle, yet could he doe no other but stand, or leaue the arme behinde. There was many a wish for <hi>Amadis</hi> his sword, against which no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment whatsoeuer could preuaile: there succeeded the malediction of his fates; there the exaggerating of the want that the world should haue of his presence, all the while hee aboade inchaunted (as he infallibly beleeued he was) in that place. There he a new remembred his beloued Lady <hi>Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea of Toboso:</hi> There did hee call oft enough on his good Squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who intombed in the bowels of sleep, and stretched along on the pannell of his Asse, did dreame, at that instant, but little of the mother that bore him. There he inuoked the wisemen <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> and <hi>Aquife,</hi> to helpe him: and finally, the morning did also there ouertake him, so full of despaire and confusion, as hee roared like a Bull; for hee had no hope that by day light any cure could bee found for his care, which he deemed would be euerlasting, because he fully accompted himselfe inchaunted; and was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thinke so, because he saw that <hi>Rozinante</hi> did not moue little nor much, and therefore he supposed, that both he and his horse should abide in that state without eating, drinking, or sleeping, vntill that either the malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Starres were passed, or some greater inchaunter had disenchaunted him.</p>
               <p>But he deceiued himselfe much in his beleefe; for scarce did the day begin to peepe, when there arriued foure horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Inne dore very well appointed, and hauing their snaphaunces banging at the pomell of their saddles. They called at the Inne dore (which yet stood shut) and knocked very hard; which being perceiued by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> from the place where he stood Centinel, he said with a very lowd, and arrogant voice. Knights or Squires, or whatsoeuer else yee be, you are not to knocke any more at the gates of that Castle, seeing it is euident, that at such houres as this, either
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:173111:261"/> they which are within, doe repose them, or else are not wont to open Fortresses vntill <hi>Phoebus</hi> hath spread his beames o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the earth: therefore stand backe, and expect till it bee cleare day, and then we will see whether it be iust or no that they open their gates vnto you. What a Diuell, what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or Fortresse is this, quoth one of them, that it should bind vs to vse all those circumstances? if thou beest the Inkeeper, command that the dore bee opened; for we are trauailers, that will carry no longer then to bait our horses, and away, for we ride in post hast. Doth it seeme to you, Gentlemen, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I looke like an Inkeeper? I know not what thou lookest like, answered the other, but well I know that thou speakest madly, in calling this Inne a Castle. It is a Castle, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> yea and that one of the best in this Prouince; and it hath people within it which haue had a Scepter in hand, and a Crowne on their head: It were better said quite contrary, replyed the trauailer, the Scepter on the head, and the Crowne in the hand. But perhaps (and so it may well be) there is some company of players within, who doe very vsually hold the Scepters, and weare those crownes whereof thou talkest: for in such a paultry Inne as this is, and where I heare so little noise, I cannot beleeue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one to be lodged worthy to weare a crowne, or beare a scepter. Thou knowest but little of the world, replyed <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> seeing thou dost so much ignore the chances that are wont to befall in Chiualry. The fellowes of him that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained this prolixe dialogue with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> waxed weary to heare them speake idlely so long together, and therefore turned againe to knocke with great fury at the dore, and that in such sort, as they not only waked the In-keeper, but also all the guests: and so he arose to demaund their pleasure.</p>
               <p>In the meane while it hapned, that one of the horses whereon they rode drew neare to smell <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and sadly with his eares cast downe, did sustayne without mouing his outstretched Lord: and he being indeed
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:173111:262"/> of flesh and bloud, although hee resembled a blocke of wood, could not choose but feele it, and turne to smell him againe, who had thus come to cherish and entertaine him: and scarce had he stirred but a thought from thence, when <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> feete, that were ioyned, slipt asunder, and tumbling from the saddle, had doubtlesly fallen to the ground, had he not remayned hanging by the arme: a thing that caused him to indure so much paine, as he verily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that either his wrest was a cutting, or his arme a tearing off from his body: and he hung so neare to the ground, as he touched it with the tops of his toes; all which turned to his preiudice; for hauing felt the little which he wanted to the setting of his feete wholly on the earth, hee laboured and drew all that he might to reach it; much like vnto those that get the <hi>strapado,</hi> with the condition to touch or not to touch; who are themselues a cause to increase their owne torture, by the earnestnesse wherewith they stretch themselues; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the hope they haue to touch the ground if they can stretch themselues but a little further.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many were the outcryes which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made, as the Inkeeper opened the dore very hastily and affrighted, to see who it was that so roared: and those that stoode without did also the same. <hi>Maritornes,</hi> whom the cryes had also awaked, imagining streight what it might be, went into the barne, and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of any, loosed the halter that sustained <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and forthwith hee fell to the ground in the presence of the Inkeeper and the trauailers; who comming towardes him,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:173111:262"/> demaunded the occasion why he did so vnmeasurably roare? he without making any answere tooke off the halter from his wrest, and getting vp, he leaped vpon <hi>Rozinante,</hi> imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his target, set his launce into the wrest, and wheeling about a good part of the field, returned with a halfe gallop, saying: whosoeuer shall dare to affirme that I haue not been with iust title inchaunted: if my Lady the Princesse <hi>Mico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micona</hi> will giue me leaue to doe it, I say that he lyes, and I doe presently challenge him to single combat. The new tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailers were amazed at <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> wordes, but the Host remoued that wonder by informing them what hee was, and that they should make no account of his words, for the man was bereft of his wits: then they demanded of the Inkeeper, if there had arriued to his Inne, a young stripling of some fifteene years old or thereabouts, apparelled like a horseboy, and hauing such and such markes and tokens: and then gaue the very signes of <hi>Donna Claras</hi> louer. The Host made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that there were so many people in his Inne as hee had taken no notice of him for whom they demaunded. But one of them hauing seene the Coach wherein the Iudge came, said: questionlesly he must be here, for this is the Coach that they say, he hath followed: let therefore one of vs remayne at the dore, and the rest enter to seeke him out. Yea and it will not be from the purpose, if one of vs ride about without the Inne, lest he should make an escape from vs by the wals of the yard. We will doe so, said another of them, and thus two of them entred into the house, one staied at the dore, and the other did compasse the Inne about. The Inkeeper beheld all, but could neuer iudge aright the reason why they vsed all this diligence, although he easily beleeued that they sought for the youth whose marks they had told vnto him.</p>
               <p>By this the day was growen cleere, and as well by reason thereof, as through the outcries of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> all the strangers were awake, and did get vp, especially both the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>Dorotea:</hi> for the one through feare to haue her louer so neere, &amp; the other with desire to see him, could
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:173111:263"/> sleepe but very little all that night. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> perceiuing that none of the foure trauellers made any account of him, or answered his challenge, was ready to burst with wrath and despite: and if he could any wise haue found that it was tollerated by the statues of Chiuelry, that a Knight errant might haue lawfully vndertaken any enterprise, hauing plight his word and faith, not to attempt any, vntil he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that which he had first promised, he would haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed them all, and made them maugre their teeth to haue answered him. But because it seemed to him not so expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor honourable, to begin any new aduenture vntill he had installed <hi>Micomicona</hi> in her Kingdome, he was forced to be quiet, expecting to see wherunto the indeauours and diligence of those four trauellers tended: the one whereof found out the youth that hee searched, asleepe by another Lackey, little dreaming that any bodie did looke for him; and much lesse would finde him out thus. The man drew him by the arme, and said, truely <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> the habite that you weare answers very well your calling, and the bedde whereon you lie, the care and tendernesse wherewith your mother did nurse you: the youth hereat rub'd his drowsie eyes, and beheld very leisurely him that did hold him fast, and knew him forthwith to be one of his fathers seruants; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he was so amazed as hee could not speake a word for a great while: and the Scruingman continuing his speech, said, Here is nothing else to be done, Lord <hi>Lewes,</hi> but that you be patient and depart againe with vs towards home, if you be not pleased to haue your father and my Lord depart out of this world to the other, for no lesse may be expected from the woe wherein he rests for your absence. Why how did my father know, said <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> that I came this way, and in this habite? A Student, answered the other, to whom you bewrayed your intention, did discouer it, moued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the compassion he tooke to heare your fathers lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations when he found you missing: &amp; so he dispatcht foure of his men in your search, and we are al at your seruice, more
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:173111:263"/> ioyfull then may be imagined, for the good dispatch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall we shall returne, and carie you to his sight, which do loue you so much. That shall be as I please, or heauen will dispose, said <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> What would you please, or what should heauen dispose of other then that you agree to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; for certainly you shall not doe the contrary, nor is it possible you should? All these reasons that passed betweene them both, did the Lackey that lay by <hi>Don Lewis</hi> here, and arising from thence, he went and tolde all that passed to <hi>Don Fernando, Cardenio,</hi> and all the rest that were gotten vp. To whom he tolde how the man gaue the title of <hi>Don</hi> to the boy, and recounted the speech he vsed, and how hee would haue him returne to his fathers house: which the youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to doe. Whereupon, and knowing already what a good voyce the heauens had giuen him, they greatly desired to be more particularly informed what he was: and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also to helpe him, if any violence were offered vnto him, and therefore went vnto the place where he was, and stood contending with his seruant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorotea</hi> issued by this out of her chamber, and in her companie <hi>Donna Clara,</hi> all perplexed. <hi>Dorotea</hi> calling <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denio</hi> aside, tolde vnto him succinctly all the historie of the Musitian, and <hi>Donna Clara:</hi> and he rehearsed to her againe all that passed of the Seruingmens arriuall that came in his pursuit, which he did not speake so low, but that <hi>Donna Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> ouerheard him, whereat she indured such alteration, as she had falne to the ground, if <hi>Dorotea</hi> running towards her, had not held her vp. <hi>Cardenio</hi> intreated <hi>Dorotea</hi> to returne with the other to her chamber, and he would endeauour to bring the matter to some good passe, which they presently performed. The foure that were come in <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his search were by this all of them entred into the Inne, and had compassed him about, perswading him that he would, cutting off all delayes, returne to comfort his father. He answered that he could not doe it in any sort, vntill he had finished an aduenture, which imported him no lesse then his life, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:173111:264"/> and his soule. The seruants vrged him then saying, that they would in no sort goe backe without him, and therefore would carrie him home, whether he would or no. That shall not you doe, quoth <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> if it be not that you carrie me home dead; and in this season all the other Gentlemen were come in to the contention, but chiefly <hi>Cardenio, Don Fernando</hi> and his <hi>Comaradas,</hi> the Iudge, the Curate, and the Barber, and <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> for now it seemed to him need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to guard the Castle any more. <hi>Cardenio</hi> who knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the History of the youth, demaunded of those that would carie him away, what reason did moue them to seeke to take that ladde away against his will? We are moued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, answered one of them by this reason that we shall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by saue his fathers life, who for the absence of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in danger to loose it. To this said <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> it is to no end to make relation of mine affaires here. I am free, and will returne if I please, and if not, no one shall constraine me to doe it perforce. Reason shall constraine you good Sir to doe it, quoth the man, and when that cannot preuaile with you, it shall with vs, to put that in execution for which we become, and which we are bound to do. Let vs know this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire from the beginning; said the Iudge then to those men: Sir, quoth one of them, who knew him very well, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters next neighbour: Master Iustice doth not your worship know this Gentleman, who is your neighbours sonne, and hath absented himselfe from his fathers house in an habite so vndecent and discrepant from his calling, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue? The Iudge beheld him then somewhat more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, knew him, and imbracing of him, said, What to yes are these <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> or what cause hath beene of efficacie suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to moue you to come away in this manner and attire, which answers your calling so ill? The teares stucke then in the young Gentlemans eyes, and hee could not answere a word to the Iudge, who bad the foure Seruing men appease themselues, for all things should be done to their satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then taking <hi>Don Lewis</hi> apart, he intreated him to tell
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:173111:264"/> him the occasion of that his departure.</p>
               <p>And whilest hee made this and other demaunds to the Gentleman, they heard a great noise at the Inne doore; the cause whereof was, that two guests which had line there that night, seeing all the people busied to learne the cause of the foure horsmens comming, had thought to haue made an escape scot-free, without defraying their expenses: but the Inkeeper who attended his owne affaires with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence then other mens did stay them at their going forth, and demaunded his money, vpbraiding their dishonest reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with such wordes, as moued them to returne him an answere with their fists, which they did so roundly as the poore Host was compelled to raise the crie, and demaund succour. The Hostesse and her daughter could see no man so free from occupation as <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to whom the daughter said, I request you, Sir Knight, by the vertue that God hath giuen you to succour my poore father, whom two badde men are grinding like corne. To this <hi>Don-Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xote</hi> answered very leisurely, and with great grauity; Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull damzell, your petition cannot preuaile at this time, for as much as I am hindred from vndertaking any other aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vntill I haue finished one wherein my promise hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me; and all that I can now doe in your seruice, is, that which I shall say now vnto you: run vnto your father, and bid him continue and maintaine his conflict manfully, as the best that he may, vntill I demaund license of the Princesse <hi>Micomicona</hi> to helpe him out of his distresse; for if she will giue it vnto me, you may make ful account that hee is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Sinner that I am (quoth <hi>Maritornes,</hi> who was by and heard what he said) before you shall be able to obtaine that license, of which you speake, my Master will be departed to the other world. Worke you so Lady, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I may haue the license; for so that I may haue it, it will make no great matter, whether hee be in the other world or no: for euen from thence would I bring him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in despite of the other world it selfe, if it durst contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:173111:265"/> me: or at least wise I will take such a reuenge of those that doe send him to the other world, as you shall remaine more then meanely contented: and so without replying any more, he went, and fell on his knees before <hi>Dorotea,</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of her in Knightly and errant phrases, that she would deigne to license him to goe and succour the Constable of that Castle, who was then plunged in a deepe distresse: The Princesse did graunt him leaue very willingly, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently buckling on his Target, &amp; laying hand on his sword, ranne to the Inne dore, where yet the two guests stood hansomly tugging the Inkeeper. But as soone as he arriued, he stopt &amp; stood still, although <hi>Maritornes</hi> and the Hostesse demaunded of him twise or thrise the cause of his restinesse in not aresting her Lord and husband. I stay, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> because according to the lawes of armes, it is not permitted to me to lay hand to my sword against Squire-like men that are not dubbed Knights. But call to me heere my Squire <hi>Sancho,</hi> for this defence and reuenge concernes him, as his duety. This passed at the Inne dore, where fists and blowes were interchangeably giuen and taken in the best sort, although to the Inkeepers cost, and to the rage and griefe of <hi>Maritornes,</hi> the Hostesse and her daughter, who were like to runne wood, beholding <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and the mischiefe their Master, husband, and father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. But here let vs leaue them; for there shall not want one to succour him, or if not let him suffer: and all those that wittingly vndertake things beyond their power and force: and let vs turne backeward to heare that which <hi>Don-Lewis</hi> answered the Iudge, whom we left somewhat apart with him, demaunding the cause of his comming a foot, and and in so base array: to which the youth wringing him hard by the hands, as an argument that some extraordinary griefe pinched his heart, and shedding many teares, answered in this manner.</p>
               <p>I know not what else I may tell you deere Sir, but that from the instant that heauen made vs neighbours, and that I

                  </gap>ndresse of my will; and if yours, my true Lord and Father, doe not hinder it, she shall be my spouse this very day. For her sake haue I abandoned my fathers house, and for her I did on this attire, to follow her wheresoeuer she went, as the arrow doth the marke, or the marriner the North starre: she is, as yet, no further acquainted with my desires, then as much as she might vnderstand some times, by the teares which she saw mine eyes distill a farre off. Now Sir, you know the riches and nobilitie of my discent, and how I am my fathers sole heire, and if it seeme vnto you that these be conditiōs, wherupon you may venture to make me throughly happy, accept of me presently for your sonne in law: for if my father, borne away by others his designes shall not like so well of this good which I haue sought out for my selfe, yet time hath more force to vndoe, and change the affaires, then mens wils: Heere the amorous Gentleman held his peace, and the Iudge remained astonied as well at the grace and discretion wherewith <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his affections vnto him, as also to see himselfe in such a passe, that as he knew not what course he might best take in so sodaine, and vnexpected a matter: and therefore he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered no other thing at that time, but onely badde him to settle his minde, and intertaine the time with his seruants, and deale with them, to expect that day, because he might haue leasure to consider what might be most conuenient for all. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> did kisse his hands perforce, and did bathe them with teares, a thing able to moue a heart of Marble, and much more the Iudges who (as a wise man) did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently perceiue, how beneficiall and honourable was that preferment for his daughter: although hee could haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, if it had beene possible to effect it with the consent of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his father, who he knew did purpose to haue his sonne made a Noble man of title.</p>
               <p>By this time the Inkeeper and his guests had agreed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paid him all that they ought more by <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:173111:266"/> perswasions, and good reasons, then by any menaces. And <hi>Don Lewes</hi> his seruants expected the end of the Iudges dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and his resolution: when the diuel (who neuer sleeps) would haue it, at that very time entred into the Inne, the Barber from whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> tooke away the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> the furniture of the Asse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he made an exchange for hir owne: which Barber lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his beast to the stable, saw <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who was mending some part of the pannell, and as soone as he had eyed him, he knew him, and presently set vpon <hi>Sancho</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; A Sir Theefe haue I found you heere with all the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereof you robd mee? <hi>Sancho</hi> that saw himselfe thus assaulted vnexpectedly, and had heard the disgraceful termes which the other vsed, laying fast hold on the pannell with the one hand, gaue the Barber such a buffet with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he bathed all his teeth in bloud: but yet for all that the Barber held fast his gripe of the pannell, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cried out so loud, as all those that were in the house came to the noyse, and conflict, and he said, I call for the king and Iustice, for this theefe and robber by the high waies goeth about to kill me, because I seeke to recouer mine owne goods, thou liest quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I am not a robber by the high waies; for my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> wonne those spoiles in a good warre. By this time <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himself was come thither, not a little proud to see how well his Squire defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe, and offended his aduersary, and therefore hee accounted him from thenceforth to be a man of valour, and purposed in his mind to dubbe him Knight, on the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that should be offered, because he thought that the order of Knighthood would be well imployed by him.</p>
               <p>Among other things that the Barber said in the discourse of his contention, this was one: Sirs, this pannell is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly mine as the death which I owe vnto God, and I know it as well as if I had bred it, &amp; there is my Asse in the stable, who will not permit me to tell a lie: or otherwise do but trie the pannell on him, and if it fit him not iustly, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:173111:266"/> to remaine infamous: and I can say more, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day wherein they tooke my pannell from mee, they robbed mee likewise of a newe brazen Basen, which was neuer vsed, and cost mee a crowne. Heere <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> could no longer containe himselfe from spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and so thrusting himselfe betweene them two, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them asunder, and causing the pannell to be laid pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely on the ground, vntill the truth were decided, he said; To the end that you may perceiue the cleere and manifest error, wherein this good Squire liues, see how he cals that a basen, which is, was, and shall be the helmet of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> which I tooke away perforce from him in faire warre, and made my selfe Lord therof, in a lawfull and warlike manner. About the pannell I will not contend, for that which I can say therein is, that my Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> demaunded leaue of me, to take away the furniture of this vanouished cowards horse, that he might adorne his owne withall: I gaue him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to doe it, and he tooke them: and for his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof from a horses furniture into a pannell, I can giue none other reason then the ordinary, one, to wit, that such transformations are vsually seene in the successes of chiualry: for confirmation whereof, friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> run spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and bring me out the helmet which this good man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth to be a basen: by my faith Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> if we haue no better proofe of our intention, then that which you say, I say that the helmet of <hi>Mambrino</hi> is as arrant a basen as this good mans furniture is a pannell: Doe what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I cannot beleeue that all the things in this Castle will be guided by enchantment. <hi>Sancho</hi> went for the basen, &amp; brought it, &amp; as soone as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw it, he tooke it in his hands and said: See Sirs with what face can this impudent Squire affirme, that this is a basen, and not the helmet that I haue mentioned: and I sweare to you all by the order of Knighthood which I professe, that this is the very same helmet which I wan from him, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing added or taken any thing from it. That it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:173111:267"/> quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for since the time that my Lord wonne it vntill now, he neuer fought but one battell with it, when he deliuered the vnlucky chained men; And but for this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen-Helmet,</hi> he had not escaped so free as hee did, so thicke a shower of stones rained all the time of that conflict.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Sirs quoth the Barber, what do you thinke of that which is affirmed by these Gentlemen, who yet contend that this is not a basen but a helmet? He that shall say the contrary, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I will make him know that he lies, if he be a Knight; and if he be but a Squire, that he lies and lies againe a thousand times. Our Barber, who was also present as one that knew <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour very wel, would fortifie his folly, and make the iest passe yet a little farther, to the end that they all might laugh: and therefore speaking to the other Barber, he said. Sir Barber, or what else you please, know that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of your occupation, and haue had my writ of examination and approbation in that trade more then these thirty yeares, and am one that knowes very well all the instruments of Barbery whatfoeuer; and haue beene besides in my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full daies a souldier, and do therefore likwiese know what is a helmet, and what a morrion, and what a close Castle, and other things touching warfare, I meane all the kinde of armes that a souldier ought to haue: and therefore I say, (still submitting my selfe to the better opinion) that this peece, which is laid heere before vs, and which this
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:173111:267"/> good Knight holdes in his hand, not onely is not a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars basen, but also is so farre from being one, as is white from blacke, or veritie from vntruth, yet doe I withall affirme, that although it is an helmet, yet it is not a compleate helmet. No truly, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for it wants the halfe, to wit, the neather part, and the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. It is very true, quoth the <hi>Curate,</hi> who very well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his friend the Barber his intention; and the same did <hi>Cardenio, Don Fernando,</hi> and his fellowes confirme: yea and euen the Iudge himselfe, had not <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his affaire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed his thoughts, would for his part haue holpen the jest well forward. But the earnestnesse of that affaire held his minde so busied, as he litle or nothing attended the pastime. Lord haue mercy vpon me, quoth the other Barber, then halfe beside himselfe, and is it possible that so many Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men should say that this is no bason, but a helmet? this is a thing able to strike admiration into a whole Vniuersitie, how discreet soeuer it were: tis enough if this basen must needes be a helmet, the pannell must also be a horses furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as this Gentleman sayes. To mee it seemes a pannell, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but as I haue said, I will not meddle with it, nor determine whether it be a pannell or the cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of a horse. Therein is nothing else to be done, said the Curate, but that Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> say it once; for in these matters of Chiualrie, all these Noblemen, and my selfe, doe giue vnto him the pricke, and the price. I sweare vnto you by Ioue good Sirs, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that so many and so strange are the things which haue befallen me in this Castle, these two times that I haue lodged therein, as I dare auouch nothing affirmatiuely of any thing that shall be demaunded of me concerning the things contayned in it, for I doe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly imagine, that all the aduentures which passe in it, are guided by inchauntment: the first time I was very much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an inchaunted <hi>Moore,</hi> that is in it: and <hi>Sancho</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sped not very well with the <hi>Moores</hi> followers: and ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternight I stood hanging almost two houres space by this
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:173111:268"/> arme, without knowing how, or how that disgrace befell me, so that for me to medle now in so confused and difficult a matter, as to deliuer mine opinion, were to passe a rash iudgement: So that which they say, that this is a bason, and no helmet, I haue already made answere; but whether this be a pannell, or furniture, I dare pronounce no definitiue sentence, but only remit it to your discreet opinions: perhaps because you are not dubbed Knights as I am, the inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this place, will haue no power ouer you, and your vnderstandings shall be free, and able to iudge of the things in this Castle really, and truly, and not as they seeme vnto me. Doubtlesse, quoth <hi>Don Fernando, Don-Quixote</hi> saies very well, that the definition of this case belongs vnto vs; and therefore, and because we may proceede in it vpon the better and more solid grounds, I will secretly take the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of all those Gentlemen, and afterwards make a cleare and full relation of what shall come of them.</p>
               <p>To those that knew <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> his humour, this was a matter of maruailous laughter, and sport; but to such as were not acquainted therewithall, it seemed the greatest folly of the world, especially to <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and his foure seruants, &amp; with other three passengers that had arriued by chance to the Inne, and seemed to be troupers of the holy Brotherhood, as indeede they were: but he that was most of all beside himselfe for wrath, was the Barber, whose ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen they had transformed before his owne face into the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of <hi>Mambrino,</hi> and whose pannell he made full account should likewise be turned into the rich furniture, and equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of a great horse. All of them laughed hartily to see <hi>Don Fernando</hi> goe vp and downe taking the suffrages of this man and that, and rounding euery one of them in the eare, that they might declare in secret whether that was a pannell or a furniture, for which such deadly contention had passed. After that hee had taken the suffrages of so many as knew <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he said very lowdly, The truth is good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that I grow weary of demaunding so many opinions;
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:173111:268"/> for I can no sooner demaund of any man what I desire to know, but they forthwith answere me, how it is meere mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to affirme, that this is the pannell of an Asse, but rather the furniture of a Horse, yea and of a chiefe horse of seruice; and therefore you must haue patience: for in despite both of you and of your Asse, and notwithstanding your weake alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and worse prooues, it is, and will continue, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of a great horse. Let me neuer inioy a place in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, quoth the Barber, if you all be not deceiued; and so may my soule appeare before God, as it appeares to mee to be a pannell, and no horse furniture: but the law carries it away, and so fare well it, and yet surely I am not drunke; for vnlesse it be by sinning, my fast hath not beene broken this day.</p>
               <p>The follies which the Barber vttered, stirred no lesse laughter among them, then did the rorings of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who then spoke in this manner: here is now no more to be done, but that euery man take vp his owne goods, and to whom God hath giuen them, let S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Peter</hi> giue his blessing. Then said one of the foure Seruingmen, if this were not a jest premeditated, and made of purpose, I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe that men of so good vnderstanding as al these are, or seeme to be, should dare to say, and affirme, that this is not a basen, nor that a pannell: but seeing that they auerre it, so constantly I haue cause to suspect, that it cannot bee without mistery to affirme a thing so contrary to that which very truth it selfe and experience demonstrate vnto vs, for I doe vow (and saying so he rapt out a round oth or two) that as many as are in the world, should neuer make me beleeue that this is no basen, nor that no pannell of a hee Asse: it might as well bee of a shee Asse, quoth the <hi>Curate:</hi> that comes all but to one, replyed the other; for the question consists not therein, but whether it be a pannell or not, as you doe auouch? Then one of the Troupers of the holy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood (who had listned to their disputation, and was growne full of choler to heare such an errour maintayned,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:173111:269"/> said: it is as very a pannell as my father is my father; and hee that hath said, or shall say, the contrary is, I beleeue, turned into a grape. Thou lyest like a clownish knaue, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and lifting vp his <hi>Iauelin,</hi> which he alwayes held in his hand, he discharged such a blow at the Troupers pate, as if hee had not auoided, it would haue throwen him to the ground: the <hi>Iaueline</hi> was broken by the force of the fall into splinters, and the other Troupers, seeing their fellow so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed, cryed out for help, and assistance for that holy Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: the Inkeeper who also was one of the same fraternity, ranne in for his rod of Iustice and his sword, and then stood by his fellowes. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his foure seruants compassed him about, lest he should attempt to escape whilst the tumult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. The Barber seeing all the house turned vpside downe, laid hand againe vpon his pannell, and the same did <hi>Sancho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> set hand to his sword, and assaulted the Troupers: <hi>Don Lewis</hi> cryed to his Seruingmen, that they should leaue him, and goe to helpe <hi>Don-Quixote, Cardenio,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando;</hi> for all of them tooke <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> part. The Curate cryed out, the Hostesse shriked, her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter squeaked, <hi>Maritornes</hi> howled, <hi>Dorotea</hi> stood confused, <hi>Luseinda</hi> amazed, and <hi>Donna Clara</hi> dismayed: the Barber battered <hi>Sancho,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> pounded him againe. <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> on whome one of his Seruingmen had presumed to lay hands, and hold him by the arme, gaue him such a pash on the mouth, as hee broke his teeth, and then the Iudge tooke him into his owne protection. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had gotten one of the Troupers vnder his feete, where he stoode belabouring him at his pleasure. The Inkeeper renewed his outcry and reinforced his voice, demaunding aide for the holy Brotherhood: so that all the Inne seemed nothing else but plains, cryes, schritches, confusions, feares, dreades, disgraces, slashes, buffets, blowes, spurnings, and effusion of bloud.</p>
               <p>In the midst of this <hi>Chaos,</hi> and Labyrinth of things, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> beganne to imagine, and fancie to himselfe, that he
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:173111:269"/> was at that very time plunged vp to the eares in the discord, and conflict of King <hi>Agramante</hi> his camp; and therefore he said with a voice that made all the Inne to tremble. All of you hold your hands, all of you put vp your swords, all of you be quiet, and listen to me, if any of you desire to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue: That great and monstrous voice made them all stand still; thereupon he thus proceeded: did not I tell you, Sirs, that this Castle was inchaunted, and that some legion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels did inhabit it? in confirmation whereof I would haue you but to note with your owne eyes, how the very discord of King <hi>Agromants</hi> camp is transferred hither, and passed euer among vs: looke how there they fight for the sword, here for the horse, yonder for the Eagle, beyond that for the helmet; and all of vs fight, and none of vs know for what. Come therefore you Master <hi>Iustice,</hi> and you Master <hi>Curate,</hi> and let the one represent King <hi>Agramant,</hi> and the other King <hi>Sobrino,</hi> and make peace and attonement among vs: for I sweare by almighty Ioue, that it is great wrong and pity, that so many Noblemen, as we are here, should be slaine for so slight causes.</p>
               <p>The troupers which did not vnderstand <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> manner of speech, and saw themselues very ill handled by <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and <hi>Cardenio,</hi> would in no wise be pacified; but the Barber was content, by reason that in the conflict both his beard and his pannell had beene torne in pieces. <hi>Sancho</hi> to his Masters voyce was quickly obedient, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a dutifull seruant. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his foure Seruingmen stood also quiet, seeing how litle was gained in being other: only the Inkeeper persisted as before, affirming that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was due vnto the insolencies of that mad man, who c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry footconfounded &amp; disquieted his Inne. Finally, the rumor was pacified for that time; the pannell remained for a horse furniture vntill the day of iudgment; the bason for a helmet, and the Inne for a Castle in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> imagination. All the broiles being now appeased, and all men accorded by the Iudges and Curates perswasions. Then began <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:173111:270"/> his seruants againe to vrge him to depart with them, and whilest he and they debated the matter together, the Iudge communicated the whole to <hi>Don Fernando, Cardenio,</hi> and the Curate desiring to know their opinions concerning that affaire, and telling them all that <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had said vnto him; whereupon they agreed that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> should tell the Seruingmen what he himselfe was, and how it was his pleasure that <hi>Don Lewis</hi> should goe with him to <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzia,</hi> where he should be cherished, and accounted of by the Marquesse his brother, according vnto his calling and deserts: for he knew well <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his resolution to be such as he would not returne into his fathers presence at that time, although they tore him into pieces. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> his quality and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his intention being vnderstood by the foure, they agreed among themselues that three of them should goe backe, to beare the tidings of all that had passed to his father, and the other should abide there to attend on him, and neuer to leaue him vntill they returned to fetch him home, or knew what else his father would commaund. And in this sort was that monstrous bulke of diuision and contention, reduced to some forme by the authority of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramant,</hi> and the wisedome of King <hi>Sobrino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the enemy of concord, and the aduersary of peace, finding his proiects to be thus illuded, and contemned, and seeing the little fruite he had gotten by setting them all by the eares, resolued once againe to trie his wits, and stirre vp new discords and troubles, which befell in this manner: The Troupers were quieted, hauing vnderstood the calling of those with whom they had contended, and retyred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from the braule, knowing that howsoeuer the cause succeeded they themselues should haue still the worst end of the staffe: but one of them, who was the very same whom <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had buffeted so well, remembred how among many other warrants which hee had to apprehend malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he had one for <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> whom the <hi>Holy brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> had commaunded to be apprehended for freeing of the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:173111:270"/> Gally-slaues (a distaster which <hi>Sancho</hi> had before hand with very great reason feared.) As soone as he remembred it, hee would needes trie whether the signes that were giuen him of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> did agree with his person, and so taking out of his bosome a scroule of parchment, hee presently found out that which he looked for, and reading it a while very leisurely, as one that was himselfe no great Clerke, at euery other word he looked on <hi>Don-Quiote,</hi> and confronted the markes of his warrant with those of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> face, and found that be was infallibly the man that was therein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: and scarce was he perswaded that it was hee, when foulding vp his parchment, and holding the warrant in his left hand, he laid holde on <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> choller with the right so strongly, as he could hardly breath: and cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude, saying, Aide for the <hi>Holy Brotherhood;</hi> and that you may perceiue how I am in good earnest, reade that warrant, wherein you shall finde that this robber by the high way side is to be apprehended. The Curate tooke the warrant, and perceiued very well that the Trouper said true, and that the markes agreed very neere with <hi>Don-Quixotes;</hi> who seeing himselfe so abused by that base rascall, as he accounted him, his choler being mounted to her height, and all the bones of his body crashing for wrath, he seised as well as he could, with both his hands on the Troupers throate, and that in such sort, as if he had not beene speedily succoured by his fellowes, he had there left his life ere <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> would haue abandoned his gripe.</p>
               <p>The Inkeeper who of force was to assist his fellow in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, forthwith repayred vnto his ayde. The Hostesse seeing her husband re-enter into contentions and brabbles, raised a new crie, whose burden was borne by her daughter and <hi>Maritornes,</hi> asking succour of heauen and those that were present. <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing all that passed; said, By the Lord, all that my Master hath said of the inchantments of this Castle is true; for it is not possible for a man to liue quietly in it one houre together. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> parted the Trouper and <hi>Don
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:173111:271"/> Quixote,</hi> and with the good will of both, vnfastned their holdes: but yet the Troupers for all this desisted not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their prisoner, and withall, that they should helpe to get him tyed, &amp; absolutely rendred vnto their wils; for so it was requisite for the King &amp; the <hi>Holy Brotherhood,</hi> in whose name they did againe demand their helpe and assistance for the arresting of that publike robber and spoyler of people in common pathes and high wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> laughed to heare them speake so idely, as he imagined, and said with very great grauity, Come hither you filthy base extractions of the dunghill, dare you terme the loosing of the inchained, the freeing of prisoners, the assisting of the wretched, the raising of such as are falne, and the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of those that are in want?

O infamous brood, worthy for your base and vile conceipt, that heauen should neuer communicate with you the vallour included in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Chiualry, we giue you to vnderstand the sinne and errour wherin you are, by not adoring the very shadow, how much more the assistance of a Knight errant?

I say againe, what madman was he that knowes not how that no priuiledge of Gentry enioyes so many preeminences, immunities, and exemptions, as that which a Knight errant acquires the day wherein he is dubd, and vndertakes the rigorous exercise of arms?

To this, he that had the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant made answere, that it concerned him not to determine whether he was mad or no, but onely to obey and execute his superiours commaund; and that he being once prisoner, they might deliuer him three hundred times, and if it were their good pleasure: for all that quoth the <hi>Curate,</hi> you may not carry him with you at this time, nor as I suppose will he suffer himselfe to be taken. To be briefe, the <hi>Curate</hi> said so much, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> plaid so many mad prankes, as the troupers themselues would haue proued greater fooles then he, if they had not manifestly discerned his defect of iudgement: and therefore they held it to be the best course to let him alone, yea and to be compounders of peace and
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:173111:272"/> amitie betweene <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> and the Barber, which still continued their most rancorous &amp; deadly contention. Finally they as the officers of Iustice, did meditate the cause, and were arbiters thereof, in such sort, as both the parties remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though not wholy contented, yet in some sort satisfied, for they onely made them exchange their pannels, but not their gyrts or headstals.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, the Curate did vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares to <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> giue to the Barber eight reals by it, and the Barber gaue backe vnto him an acquittance of the receit thereof, and an euerlasting release of all actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. These two discords which were the most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and of most consequence, being thus accorded, it onely rested that three of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his seruingmen would be content to returne home, and leaue the fourth to accompany his master whither <hi>Don Fernando</hi> pleased to carry him. And as good hap and better fortune had already begun to breake Lances, and facilitate difficulties, in the fauour of the louers, and worthie persons of the Inne, so did it resolue to proceede forward, and giue a prosperous successe vnto all: for the seruingman were content to doe whatsoeuer their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster would haue them: whereat <hi>Donna Clara</hi> was so cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as no one beheld when her face in that season, but might reade therein the in ward contentment of her mind. <hi>Zorayda</hi> although she did not very well vnderstand all the successes of the things she had seene, yet was she interchangeably grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and cheered according to the shewes made by the rest, but chiefly by her <hi>Spanyard,</hi> on whom her eyes were alwaies fixed, and all the affects of her minde depended. The Inkee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who did not forget the recompence made by the Curate to the Barber, demaunded of him <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and satisfaction for the dammage he had done to his wine bags, and the losse of his wine, swearing that neither <hi>Rozināte,</hi> nor <hi>Sancho</hi> his Asse should depart out of the Inne vntill he were paid the very last farthing. All was quietly ended by the <hi>Curate,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> paid the whole
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:173111:272"/> summe; although the iudge had also most liberally offered to doe it; and all of them remained afterwards in such qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse and peace, as the Inne did no longer resemble the discorded campe of <hi>Agramante,</hi> (as <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> termed it) but rather enioyed the very peace and tranquility of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours <hi>Octauians</hi> time: for all which, the cōmon opinion was, that thanks were iustly due to the sincere proceeding and great eloquence of Master <hi>Curate,</hi> and to the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberality, and goodnesse of <hi>Don Fernando, Don-Quixote,</hi> perceiuing himselfe free, and deliuered from so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and brabbles, wherewith as well he, as his Esquire had beene perplexed) held it hightime to prosecute his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced voyage, and bring to an end the great aduenture vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he was called and chosen. Therefore with reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute determination to depart, he went and cast himselfe on his knees before <hi>Dorotea,</hi> who not permitting him to speake vntill he arose, he to obey her, stood vp, and said. It is a common prouerbe, beautifull Ladie, <hi>That diligence is the mother of good hap:</hi> and in many and graue affaires, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath shewed, that the sollicitude and sore of the suiter oft brings a doubtfull matter to a certaine and happy end. But this truth appeares in nothing more cleerly, then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of warre; wherein celerity and expedition preuent the enemies dessignes, and obtaine the victory before an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary can put himselfe in defence: all this I say, high and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ladie, because it seemes to mee that our abode in this Castle is nothing profitable, and many therewithall turne so farre to our hinderance, as we may palpably seele it one day. For who knowes but that your enemie, the Giant hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by spies, or other secreet intelligence and meanes, how I meane to come and destroy him, and (oportunitie fauouring his dissignes) that he may haue fortified himselfe in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable Castle or Fortresse, against the strength whereof neither mine industrie, nor the force of mine inuincible arme can much preuaile; wherefore, deare Ladie, let vs preuent (as I haue sayde by our diligence, and let vs presently depart
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:173111:273"/> vnto the place wherunto we are called by our good fortune, which shalbe deferred no longer then I am absent from your highnesse foe. Heere he held his peace, and did expect, with great grauitie the beautifull Princesse answere: who with debonary countenance, and a stile accommodated vnto <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> returned him this answere. I do gratifie and thanke Sir Knight, the desire you shew to assist me in this my great neede: which denotes very cleerely the great care you haue to fauour orphanes and distressed wightes: and I beseech God that your good desires and mine may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, to the ende that you may see how there are some thankfull women on earth: as touching my departure, let it be forthwith, for I haue none other will, thē that which is yours; therfore you may dispose of me at your owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for she that hath once committed the defence of her person vnto you, and hath put into your hands the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her estate, ought not to seeke to do any other thing then that which your wisedome shall ordaine. In the name of God (quoth <hi>Don-Quixote)</hi> seeing that your highnes doth so humble your selfe vnto mee, I will not lose the occasion of exalting it, and installing it againe in the throne of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Let our departure be incontinent for my desires, and the way, and that which they call the danger that is in delay, doe spurre me on. And seeing that heauen neuer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor hell euer beheld any man that could affright me, or make a coward of me, go therefore <hi>Sancho</hi> and saddle <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinante,</hi> and empannell thine Asse, and make readie the Queenes palfrey, and let vs take leaue of the Constable and these other Lords, and depart away from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sancho</hi> (who was present at all this) wagging of his head, said: O my Lord, my Lord, how much more knauerie (be it spoken with the pardon of all honest kerchefes) is there in the little village then is talked of? what ill can there be in any village, or in all the Cities of the world, able to impaire my credite, thou villaine? If thou be angrie, quoth
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:173111:273"/>
                  <hi>Sancho,</hi> I will hold my tongue, and omit to say that which by the dutie of a good Squire, and of an honest seruant I am bound to tell you, say what thou wilt quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> so thy words be not addrest to make me afraid; for if thou beest frighted, thou doest onely like thy selfe; and if I bee deuoid of terrour, I also doe that which I ought, it is not that which I meane quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> but that I doe hold for most sure &amp; certaine that this Ladie which cals her selfe Queene of the great Kingdome of <hi>Micomicon,</hi> is no more a Queene then my mother; for if she were what she saies, she would not at euery corner, and at euery turning of a hand be billing as she is, with one that is in this good company: <hi>Dorotea</hi> blushed at <hi>Sanchos</hi> words; for it was true indeede that her spouse <hi>Don Fernando</hi> would now and then priuately steale from her lips some part of the reward which his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires did merit, (which <hi>Sancho</hi> espying, it seemed to him, that that kinde of wanton familiarity was more proper to curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans, then becomming the Queene of so great a Kingdome) and yet she neither could, nor would reply vnto him, but let him continue his speech, as followeth: This I doe say, good my Lord quoth he, to this end, that if after wee haue runne many waies and courses, and indured bad nights and worse daies, he that is in this Inne, sporting himselfe, shall come to gather the fruit of our labours, there is no reason to hasten me thus to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> or empannell the Asse, or make readie the Palfrey, seeing it would bee better that we stayed still, and that euery whoore spunne, and we fell to our victuals.</p>
               <p>O God, how great was the fury that inflaming <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> when he heard his Squire speake so respectlesly. I say it was so great, that with a shaking voyce, a faultering tongue, and the fire sparking out of his eyes he said. O villanous peasant, rash, vnmannerly, ignorant, rude, blasphemous, bold murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and detractor, hast thou presumed to speake such words in my presence, and in that of these noble Ladies? and hast thou dared to entertaine such rash and dishonest surmises
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:173111:274"/> into thy confused imagination? depart out of my sight thou monster of nature, storehouse of vntruthes, armorie of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, sincke of roguerie, inuentor of villanie, publisher of rauings, and the enemie of that decency which is to be vsed towards royall persons. Away villaine, and neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before mee, vnder paine of mine indignation: and saying so he bended his browes, fild vp his cheekes, looked about him on euery side, and strucke a great blow with his right foote on the ground; all manifest tokens of the rage which inwardly fretted him: at which words and furious gestures poore <hi>Sancho</hi> remained so greatly affrighted, as he could haue wished in that instant, that the earth opening vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feete would swallow him vp. And knew not what to doe, but turne his backe, and get him out of his Lords most furious presence: but the discreete <hi>Dorotea</hi> (who was now so well schooled in <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> humour) to mitigate his yre said vnto him; be not offended good <hi>Sir Knight of the sad face,</hi> at the idle words which your good Squire hath spoken: for perhaps he hath not saide them without some ground, nor of his good vnderstanding and Christian mind can it be suspected, that he would wittingly slaunder or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse any body falsely: And therefore we must beleeue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, that as in this Castle as you your selfe haue said, Sir Knight all things are represented, and succeed by manner of inchantment, I say it might befall, that <hi>Sancho</hi> may haue seene by diabolicall illusion, that which he saies, he behold so much to the preiudice of my reputation, I vow by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent <hi>Ioue,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that your highnes hath hit the very pricke, &amp; that some wicked vision appeared to this sinner, my man <hi>Sancho,</hi> that made him to see that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise were impossible to be seene by any other way then that of inchantment: for I know very well the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and simplicitie of that poore wretch is such, as hee knowes not how to inuent a lye on any bodie liuing. It is euen so, and so it shall be quoth <hi>Don Fernando:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> you must pardon him, &amp; reduce
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:173111:274"/> him againe to the bosome of your good grace: <hi>Sicut erat in principio,</hi> and before the like visions did distract his sense. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, that he did willingly pardon him: and therefore the <hi>Curate</hi> went for <hi>Sancho,</hi> who returned very humbly, and kneeling downe on his knees demaunded his Lords hand, which he gaue vnto him, and after that hee had permitted him to kisse it, he gaue him his blessing, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now thou shalt finally know <hi>Sancho,</hi> that which I haue told thee diuers times, how that all the things of this Castle are made by way of inchauntment. So doe I verily beleeue, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> except that of the Canuassing in the blanquet, which really succeeded by an ordinary and naturall way: doe not beleeue that, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for if it were so, I would both then, and also now haue taken a dire reuenge: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, nor now could I euer see any, on whom I might reuenge that thine iniurie. All of them desired greatly to know what that accident of the blanquet was, and then the Inkeeper recounted it point by point, the flights that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Panca</hi> made, whereat they all did laugh not a little, and <hi>Sancho</hi> would haue beene ashamed no lesse, if his Lord had not anew perswaded him, that it was a meere inchauntment: And yet <hi>Sanchos</hi> madnesse was neuer so great as to beleeue that it was not a reall truth, verily befallen him without any colour, or mixture of fraude, or illusion: but that hee was tossed by persons of flesh, bloud, and bone, and not by drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and imagined shadowes or spirits, as his Lord belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and so constantly affirmed.</p>
               <p>Two dayes were now expired, when all that Noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had soiourned in the Inne, and then it seeming vnto them high time to depart, they deuised how (without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Dorotea</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando</hi> to the paines, to turne back with <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> to his Village, vnder pretence of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Queene <hi>Micomicona)</hi> the Curate and Barber might carry him backe as they desired, and indeauour to haue him cured of his folly in his owne house. And their inuention was this; they agreed with one, who by chaunce passed by that
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:173111:275"/> way with a Teame of Oxen, to carry him in this order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. They made a thing like a Cage of timber, so bigge as that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> might sit, or lye in it at his ease: and presently after <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and his fellowes, with <hi>Don Lewis</hi> his seruants, the Troupers, and the Inkeeper, did all of them by Master Curates direction couer their faces and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise themselues, euery one as he might best, so that they might seeme to <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> other people then such as he had seene in the Castle. And this being done, they entred with very great silence into the place where hee slept, and tooke his rest after the related conflicts: and approching him who slept securely, not fearing any such accident, and laying hold on him very strongly, they tyed his hands and his feete very strongly, so that when hee started out of his sleepe, hee could not stirre himselfe, nor doe any other thing, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and wonder at those strange shapes which he saw stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before him: and presently he fel into the conceipt which his continuall and distracted imagination had already sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vnto him, beleeuing that all those strange figures were the spirits and shadowes of that inchaunted Castle, and that he himselfe was now without doubt inchaunted, seeing hee could neither moue nor defend himselfe. All this succeeded iust as the Curate (who plotted the jest) made full account it would. Only <hi>Sancho,</hi> among all those that were present, was in his right sense and shape; and although hee wanted but little to be sicke of his Lords disease, yet for all that hee knew all those counterfait Ghosts: but hee would not once vnfold his lips, vntill hee might see the end of that surprisall and imprisonment of his Master. Who likewise spoke neuer a word, but only looked to see what would be the period of his disgrace. Which was, that bringing him to the Cage, they shut him within, and afterwards nailed the barres ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so well as they could not be easily broken. They present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted him vpon their shoulders, and as he issued out at the chamber dore, they heard as dreadfull a voice as the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could deuise (not he of the pannell but the other) which
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:173111:275"/> said: <hi>O Knight of the sadde countenance bee not grieued at the imprisonment whereinto thou art led, for so it must bee, that thereby the aduenture into which thy great force and valour haue thrust thee, may bee the more speedily ended; and ended it will be when the furious Manchegal Lyon, and the white Tobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Doue, shall be vnited in one, and after they haue humbled their lofty crest vnto the soft yoke of wedlocke: from whose won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull consort, shall issue to the light of the Orbe, fierce whelps which shal imitate the raunching pawes of their valorous father, and this shall bee, before the pursuer of the fugitiue nymphe doe with his swift and naturall course make two turnes, in visitation of the glistring Images; And thou O the most noble, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Squire, that euer had sword at a gyrdle, beard on a face, or dent in a nose, let it not dismay, or discontent thee to see car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away before thy eyes the flower of all Chiualrie errant. For very speedily, if it please the framer of the world, thou shalt see thy selfe so exalted and ennobled, as thou shalt scarce knowe thy selfe: Nor shalt thou bee defrauded of the promises made vnto thee by thy Noble Lord: and I doe assure thee, from the wise</hi> Mentironiana, <hi>that thy wages shall be payed thee, as thou shalt quickly see in effect: and therefore follow the steps of the valorous and inchaunted Knight; for it is necessary, that thou goe to the place where you both shall stay: and because I am not permitted to say any more, farewell; for I doe returne I well know whither.</hi> Towards the end of this prophecie, he lifted vp his voice, and afterwards lesned it with so slender an accent, that euen those which were acquainted with the jest, almost beleeued what they had heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was very much comforted by the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; for hee presently apprehended the whole sense thereof, and perceiued how hee was promised in marriage his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> from whose happy wombe should sally the Whelps (which were his sonnes) to the eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Mancha.</hi> And beleeuing all this most firmely, hee eleuated his voice, and breathing forth a great sigh, thus said: <hi>O thou whatsoeuer thou beest, which hast prognosticated so great
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:173111:276"/> good to me, I desire thee to request in my name, the wiseman who hath charge to record mine acts, that he permit me not to perish in this prison (to which they now do carry me) before the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of so ioyfull and incomparable promises, as now haue beene made vnto me. For so that this may befall, I will account the paines of my prison a glory, and the chaines that inuiron me an ease: and will not esteeme this bed whereon I am laid a hard field of battaile, but a soft ticke, and a most fortunate lodging. And as concerning the consolation of my Squire</hi> Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, <hi>I trust in his goodnesse, and honest proceeding, that he will not abandon me in good or bad fortune: for though it should fall out through his, or my hard hap, that I shall not bee able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on him an Iland, or other equiualent thing, as I haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, his wages at least cannot be lost, for in my Testament, which is made already I haue set downe what he is to haue, though not conformably to his many good seruices, yet according to my pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility. Sancho Panca</hi> bowed his head with great reuerence, and kissed both his hands (for one alone he could not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they were bound together) and presently those visions did lift vp the cage, and accommodate it on the Teame of Oxen.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saw himselfe to bee inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after that manner, and placed in the Cart he said, I haue read many and very graue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of Knights errant, but I neuer read, saw, nor heard, that they were wont to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knights errant inchaunted after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with the leisure that those slothfull and heauy beasts doe threaten: forthey were euer accustomed to be carried in
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:173111:276"/> the aire with wonderful speed, shut in some duskie &amp; obscure clowd; or in som fiery chariot; or on som <hi>Hippogrifus,</hi> or some other such like beast: but that they cary me now on a Terme of Oxen, I protest it driues me into a great amazement, but perhaps both Chiualrie, and the inchauntments of those our times, doe follow a course different from those of former ages: and peraduenture it may also bee, that as I am a new Knight in the world, and the first that hath againe reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the now-neglected, and forgotten exercise of armes, so haue they also newly inuented other kinds of inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other manners of carrying away inchaunted Knights. What doest thou thinke of this Sonne <hi>Sancho?</hi> I know not, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> what to thinke, because I am not so well seene in Scriptures errant as you are; but for all this I durst affirme and sweare, that these visions which goe vp and downe in this place are not altogether Catholike. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, my father, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> how can they bee Catholikes, when they be all Diuels, which haue assumed phantasticall bodies to come and put me into this state? and if thou wilt proue the truth hereof, doe but bouch and feele them, and thou shalt finde them to haue no bodies, but of aire, and that they consist of nothing but an outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Now by my faith Sir, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> I haue already touched them, and find this Diuell that goeth there so busily vp and downe, both plump and soft fleshed; and that hee hath besids an other property very different from that which I haue heard say Diuels haue: for it is said, that they smell all of brimstone and other filthy things; but one may feele at least halfe a league off, the ambar that this Diuell smels off. <hi>Sancho</hi> spoke this of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who belike (as Lords of his ranke are wont) had his attyre perfumed with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.</p>
               <p>Maruell not thereat friend <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for the diuels are very craftie; and although they bring smels or persumes about them, yet they themselues smell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (because they are spirits) or if they doe smell ought it is
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:173111:277"/> not good, but euill and stinking sauors: the reason is, for that as they doe alwayes beare wheresoeuer they be, their hell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and can receiue no kind of ease of their torments, and good smels bee thinges that delight and please; it is not possible that they can smell any good thing: and if it seeme to thee, that that diuell whom thou dost mention, smels of <hi>Ambar,</hi> either thou art deceiued, or he that would deceiue thee, by making thee to thinke that he is no diuell. All these discourses passed betweene the Master and the man; the whilst <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and <hi>Cardenio</hi> (fearing least <hi>Sancho</hi> should finde out the deceit whereto he was already come very neere) resolued to hasten the Knights departure; and therefore calling the Inkeeper aside, they commaunded him to saddle <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and empannell <hi>Sancho</hi> his beast; which he did with all expedition: and the Curate agreed with the Troupers for so much a day to accompany him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his village. <hi>Cardenio</hi> hanged at the pommell of <hi>Rozinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> saddle, the Target on the one side, and on the other the Bason, and by signes commaunded <hi>Sancho</hi> to get vp on his Asse and leade <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the bridle; and afterwards pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on either side of the Cart two Troupers with their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes.</p>
               <p>But before the Cart departed, the Hostesse, her daughter, and <hi>Maritornes</hi> came out to bid <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> farewell, fayning that they wept for sorrow of his disaster; to whom <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> said: My good Ladies doe not weepe for all these mischances are incident to those which professe that which I doe: and if these calamities had not befalne me, I would neuer haue accounted my selfe for a famous Knight errant: for the like chances neuer happen to Knights of little name or renoune, because there are none in the world that makes any mention of them. But they often befall to the valorous, who haue emulators of their vertue and valour, both many Princes and many other Knights that striue by indirect meanes to destroy them. But for all that, vertue is so potent, as by herselfe alone (in despite of all the Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:173111:277"/> that euer the first inuenter thereof <hi>Zoroastes</hi> knew) she will come off victorious from euery danger, and will shine in the world as the Sunne doth in heauen: Pardon me faire Ladies if by any carelesnesse I haue done you any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, for with my will and knowledge I neuer wronged any. And pray vnto God for me, that he will please to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me out of this prison, whereinto some ill meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter hath thrust me; for if I once may see my selfe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty againe, I will neuer forget the fauours which you haue done me in this Castle, but greatly acknowledge and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them as they deserue. Whilest the Ladies of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle were thus intertained by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> the Curate and Barber tooke leaue of <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his companions, of the Captaine and his brother, and of all the contented La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, specially of <hi>Dorotea</hi> and <hi>Luscinda,</hi> all of them embraced and promised to acquaint one another with their succeeding fortunes. <hi>Don Fernando</hi> intreating the Curate to write vnto him what became of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> assuring him that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire he could informe him of should please him better then that, and that he would in lieu thereof acquaint him with all occurrences which he thought would delight him eyther concerning his owne marriage or <hi>Zoraydas</hi> baptisme, or the successe of <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Luscindas</hi> returne into her house.</p>
               <p>The Curate offered willingly to accomplish to a haire all that he had commaunded him: and so they returned once againe to embrace one another, &amp; to renew their mutuall &amp; complementall offers. The Inkeeper came also to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and gaue him certaine papers, saying, that he had found them within one of the linings of the wallet, wherein the Tale of the curious impertinent was had; and that since the owner did not returne to fetch it, he bad him take them all with him: for seeing he could not reade, hee would keepe them no longer. Master Curate yeelded him many thanks; and then opening them, found in the beginning therof these wordes: <hi>The Tale of Riconnette and Cortadillo,</hi> by which he
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:173111:278"/> vnderstood that it was some History, and collected that it must be a good one, seeing that of the curious Impertinent, contriued perhaps by the same Authour, had proued so well, and therefore he laid it vp, with an intention to reade it as soone as he had oportunity. Then hee mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe with his friend the Barber; and both of them putting on their maskes that they might not quickly be knowne by <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> they trauelled after the teame, which held on in this order; first went the Cart, guided by the Carter: on both sides thereof the Troupers rode with their firelockes: then followed <hi>Sancho</hi> vpon his Asse, leading <hi>Rozinante</hi> by the bridle; and last of all came the Curate and Barber vpon their mighty Mules, and with their faces couered: all in a graue gesture, and with an Alderman-like pace, and trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no faster then the slow steps of the heauie Oxen permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> sate with his hands tyed, his legges stretched out, and leaning against the barre of the Cage, with such a silence, and patience, as he rather seemed a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue then a man. In this quiet and leisurely manner they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled for the space of two leagues, when arriuing to a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, it seemed to their Conductor a fit place to repose and bait his Oxen. And acquainting the Curate with his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Barber was of opinion that they should yet goe on a little further, because he knew that there lay behinde a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mountaine, which was within their view a certaine vale, much better furnished with grasse then that wherein hee meant to abide. The barbarous opinion was allowed, and therefore they continued on their trauell, when the Curate looking by chance behinde him, saw comming after them sixe or seauen men on horsebacke, and very well appointed, who quickly got ground of them; for they came not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie and flegmaticke pace of Oxen, but as men that were mounted on Canons Mules, and pricked forward with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to passe ouer the heat of the day in their Inne, which was not much more then a league from thence. Finally, those diligent trauellers ouertooke our slouthfull ones, and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:173111:278"/> them courteously, and one of them that was a Canon of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and Master of the rest, noting the orderly procession of the Cart, Troupers, <hi>Sancho, Rozinante,</hi> the Curate and Barber, but chiefly the ingaged <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> he could not forbeare to demand what meaned the carriage of that man, in so strange a manner, although he did already coniecture by obseruation of the Troupers that hee was some notable robber or other delinquent, the punishment of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Holy Brotherhood.</hi> One of the Troupers to whom the demaund was made, did answere in this manner: Sir we know not wherefore this Knight is caried in this forme, and therefore let he himselfe, who best may, tell you the reason thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> had ouerheard their discourse, and said, if Gentlemen you be conuersant and skilfull in matters of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry, I will communicate my misfortunes with you, but if you be not, I haue no reason to trouble my selfe to recouer them. The Curate and Barber seeing the trauellers in talke with <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> drew neere to make answere for him, in such sort that their inuention might not be discouered; the whilest the Canon replied to the Knight, and said, Truely brother I am better acquainted with bookes of Knighthood then with <hi>Ʋillapandas</hi> Logicke: and therefore if all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie rest onely in that, you may safely communicate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you will with me. A Gods name be it, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> You shall therefore vnderstand Sir Knight, that I am caried away inchanted in this Cage, through the enuie and fraude of wicked Magicians, <hi>For vertue is much more persecuted of the wicked, then honoured of the good.</hi> I am a Knight errant, but none of those whose names are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the bookes of fame, but one of those who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of enuie it selfe, and of all the Magicians of <hi>Persia,</hi> the Bracmanes of <hi>India,</hi> or the Gymnosophists of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> shal hang his name in the Temple of <hi>Eternity,</hi> that it may serue as a modell and patterne to insuing ages; wherein Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may view the steps which they are to follow if they
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:173111:279"/> meane to aspire to the toppe and honourable height of armes. The Knight Sir <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> saith true, quoth the Curate, speaking to the trauellers, that he is carried away in this Chariot inchanted, not through his owne default or sinnes, but through the malignant treacherie of those, to whom vertue is loathsome and valour odious. This is good Sir, the <hi>Knight of the sad countenance</hi> (if you haue at any time heard speake of him) whose valorous acts shall remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculped in stubborne Brasse, and time-suruiuing Marble, though Enuie and Malice doe labour neuer so much to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure them.</p>
               <p>When the Canon heard the imprisoned man and the free speake thus in one tenour, hee was about to blesse himselfe for wonder, and could not coniecture what had befallen him, and into no lesse admiration were they brought that came with him. But <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> hauing in the meane time approched to heare their speech, to plaister vp the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, added: now Sirs, whether you will loue me well or ill, for what I shall say, the very truth of the matter is, that my Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> is as much inchaunted as my mother, and no more. For his iudgement is yet whole and sound; hee eates, and drinks, and doth his necessities as other men doe, and as he himselfe did yesterday, and other daies before they incaged him: all which being so, how can you make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he goeth inchaunted, for I haue heard many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons auouch, that inchaunted persons neither eate, nor drinke, nor speake, and yet my Lord, if he be not thwarted, will talke more then twentie barresters, and then turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Curate, he said: O M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Curate, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Curate, doe you thinke that I doe not know you? and thinke you that I doe not suppose, yea and presage whereto these new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments are addressed? well know then, that I know you well, although you couer your face neuer so much, and that I vnderstand your meaning, how deepely soeuer you smother your drifts: but in fine, where emulation and enuy raines, vertue cannot liue; where pinching swayes, liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:173111:279"/> goes by. A pox take the Diuell, for but for your reuerence my Lord had ere this time beene wedded to the Princesse <hi>Micomicona,</hi> and I my selfe had beene created an Earle at least, for no lesse might be expected either from the bountie of my Lord, or the greatnesse of my deserts: but now I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that to bee true, which is commonly said, <hi>That the wheele of Fortune turnes about more swiftly then that of a mil: and that they which were yesterday on the top thereof, lye to day all along on the ground.</hi> I am chiefly grieued for my wife and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hildren; for whereas they ought and might hope to see their father come in at his gates, made a Gouernour, or Viceroy of some Ile, or Kingdome, they shall now see him returne vnto them no better then a poore horse-boy. All which I haue vrged so much, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Curate, only to intimate to your paternitie, how you ought to haue remorse, and make a scruple of conscience, of treating my deare Lord as you do, and looke to it well that God doe not one day demaund at your hands, in the other life, amends for the prison wherein you carry him: and that you bee not answerable for all the succours and good deedes, which hee would haue afforded the world in this time of his captiuitie. Snuffe me those can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, quoth the Barber, hearing him speake so: what <hi>Sancho,</hi> art thou also of thy Masters confraternitie? I sweare by the Lord, I beginne to see that thou art very like to keepe him company in the cage, and that thou shalt bee as deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted as hee, for the portion which thou hast of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Chiualrie. Thou wast in an ill houre begotten with child by his promises, and in a worse did the Isle, which thou so greatly longest for, sinke into thy pate: I am not with child by any body, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> nor am I a man of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to let any body get me with child, no though it were the King himselfe: and although I be poore, yet am I a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> and owe nothing to any one; and if I desire Ilands, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are that desire worse things, <hi>and euery one is the sonne of his owne workes:</hi> and vnder the name of a man, I may become Pope, how much more the Gouernour of an Iland;
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:173111:280"/> and chiefly seeing my Lord may gaine so many as hee may want men to bestow them on, and therefore M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Barber you should take heede how you speake; for all consists not in trimming of beards: and there is some difference betweene <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> I say it because all of vs know one another, and no man shall vnperceiued put a false Die vpon mee. As concerning my Lords inchantment, God knowes the truth, and therefore let it rest as it is, seeing it is the worse for the stirring in. The Barber would not reply vnto <hi>Sancho,</hi> least that with his simplicities, hee should discouer what the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and himselfe did, laboured so much to conceale, and the Curate doubting the same, had intreated the Canon to prick on a little forward, and he would vnfold to him the mysterie of the encaged Knight, with other matters of delight. The Canon did so, and taking his men along with them, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentiue to all that he rehearsed, of the condition, life, madnesse, and fashions of <hi>Don-Quixote.</hi> There did he briefly acquaint him with the originall cause of his distraction, and all the progresse of his aduentures, vntill his shutting vp in that cage: and their owne designe in carrying home to his Countrey, to trie whether they might by any meanes finde out a remedy for his frensie. The Canon and his men againe admired to heare so strange a Historie as that of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and as soone as the Curate had ended his relation, the Canon said.</p>
               <p>Verily Master Curate I doe finde by experience that those bookes which are instituted of chiualrie, or knighthood, are very preiudiciall to welgouerned commowealths: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (borne away by an idle and curious desire) I haue read the beginning of almost as many as are imprinted, of that subiect, yet could I neuer indure my selfe to finish and reade any one of them through: for me thinks that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more or lesse, they all import one thing, and this hath no more then that, nor the other more then his fellow. And in mine opinion this kind of writing and inuention fals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of the fables called <hi>Malesiae,</hi> which are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:173111:280"/> and idle tales, whose onely scope is delight, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; quite contrary to the proiect of those called <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae Apologae,</hi> which delight and instruct together. And though that the principall ende of such bookes be recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yet cannot I perceiue how they can yeelde it, seeing they be forced with so many, and so proportionlesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. For the delight that the mind conceiues, must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the beautie, and conformitie which it sees or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates in such things as the sight, or imagination repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents vnto it; and all things that are deformed, or discordant must produce the contrary effect. Now then what beautie can there be, or what proportion betweene the parts, and the whole, or the whole and the parts, in a booke or fable, wherein a youth of sixteene yeares of age giues a blow to a Giant as great as a Iewes, and with that blow deuides him in two as easily as if he were a pellet of Sugar. And when they describe a battell, after that they haue tolde vs how there were at least a million of men on the aduerse side, yet if the Knight of the booke be against them, wee must of force, and whether we will or no, vnderstand that the said Knight obtained the victory through the inuincible strength of his arme? what then shall we say of the facilitie wherewithall the Inheretrix of a Kingdome, or Empyre falles betweene the armes of one of those errant and vnknowne knights? what vnderstanding, if it be not altogether barren or barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, can delight it selfe, reading how a great tower full of knights doth passe through the Sea as fast as a ship with the most prosperous wind? And that going to bed a man is in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> and the next morning findes himselfe in <hi>Prester Iohns</hi> countrey, among the <hi>Indians)</hi> or in some other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which neuer was discouered by <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> nor seene by <hi>Marcus Polus?</hi> and if I should be answered, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors of such bookes do write them as fables: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not bound vnto any respect of circumstances, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of truth, I would reply, that an vntruth is so much the more pleasing, by how much the neerer it resembles a
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:173111:281"/> truth; and so much the more gratefull, by how much the more it is doubtfull and possible: for lying fables must bee suited vnto the readers vnderstanding, and so written, as that facilitating impossible things, leuelling vntrue things, and holding the mind in suspence, they may rauish a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and entertaine such manners, as pleasure and wonder may step by step walke together, all which things hee that writes not likelihoods, shall neuer be able to performe. And as touching Imitation (wherein consistes the perfection of that which is written) I haue not seene in any bookes of Knighthoode, an entire bulke of a fable, so proportioned in all the members thereof, as that the middle may answere the beginning, &amp; the end the beginning and middle. But rather they haue composed them of so many members, as it more probably seemes, that the authors intended to frame <hi>Chimeraes</hi> or monsters, then to deliuer proportionate figures, most harsh in their stile, incredible in exploits, impudent in loue matters, absurd in complements, prolixe in battels, fond in discourses, vncertaine and senselesse in voyages, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, deuoide of all discretion, art and ingenious disposition. And therefore they deserue (as most idle and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things) to be banished out of all Christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes.</p>
               <p>Master Curate did listen to the Canon with very great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and he seemed vnto him to be a man of good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and that he had great reason for what hee had alledged: and therfore said, that in respect they did concurre in opinions, and that he had an old grudge to the vanity of such bookes, he had likewise fired all <hi>Don-Quoxotes</hi> library, consisting of many bookes of that subiect: And then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him the search and inquisition hee had made of them; and which he had condemned, and which reserued; whereat the Canon laughed heartily, and said, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the euill he had spoken of such bookes, yet did he find one good in them, to wit, the subiect they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a good wit to worke vpon, and shew it selfe in them;
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:173111:281"/> for they displayed a large and open plaine, through which the Pen might runne without let or incumbrances; descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of shipwracks, tempests, incounters, and battels: deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neating a valorous Captaine, with all the properties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him; as wisedome to frustrate the designes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie; eloquence to perswade or disswade his souldiers; ripenesse in aduice; promptnesse in execution; as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in attending as in assaulting of an enemie. Deciphering now a lamentable and tragicall successe, then a ioyfull and vnexpected euent; there a most beautifull, honest, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Ladie, heere a valiant, courteous, &amp; Christian knight, there an vnmeasurable barbarous braggard; heere a gentle, valorous, and wise Prince: Representing the goodnesse and loyalty of subiects, the magnificence and bountie of Lords: Sometimes he may shew himselfe an <hi>Astrologian,</hi> sometimes a Cosmographer, sometimes a Musitian, sometimes a Statist, and sometimes if he please, he may haue occasion to shew himselfe a Nigromancer: There may he demonstrate the subtiltie of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> the pietie of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the valour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> the misfortunes of <hi>Hector,</hi> the trechery of <hi>Sinon,</hi> the amitie of <hi>Eurialus,</hi> the liberality of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the clemency and truth of <hi>Traianus,</hi> the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie of <hi>Zopirus,</hi> the prudence of <hi>Cato;</hi> and finally all those parts that make a worthy man perfect: one whiles by placing them all in one subiect; another by distributing them among many: and this being done, and set out in a pleasing stile, and a wittie fashion that approacheth as neere as is possible vnto the truth, will questionlesse remaine a worke of many faire draughts, which being accomplished, will represent such beauty and perfection, as shall fully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the best end aymed at in all writing, that is, as I haue said, ioyntly to instruct, and delight: for the irregularity, and liberality of those bookes giuen to the author, the means to shew himselfe an <hi>Epicke, Lyricke, Tragedian,</hi> and <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian;</hi> with all other things which the most gracefull and pleasant sciences of Poetry and Oratorie include in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Canon prosecutes his discourse vpon bookes of Chiualrie, and many other thinges worthy of his wit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou say very true, quoth the Curate; and for this very reason are they, which haue hitherto inuented such bookes, the more worthy of reprehension, because they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heeded the good discourse, the arte, nor the rules, by which they might haue guided themselues, and by that meanes haue growen as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their prose as be the two Princes of the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poetrie for their verse. I haue for my part, quoth the Canon, at least attempted to write a booke of Chiualrie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing therein all the points by me mentioned; and in truth I haue written aboue a hundred sheetes thereof: and to the end that I might trie whether they were correspondent to my estimation, I did communicate them, both with certaine skilfull and wise men, that are maruailously affected to that subiect, and with some ignorant persons that only delight to heare fanaticall inuentions; and I haue found in them all a gratefull approbation of my labours: yet would I not for all that, prosecute the worke, as well because it seemed vnfit for my profession, as also because I finde the number of the ignorant to exceede that of the iudicious: and though more good come to a man by the praise of a few wisemen, then hurt by the scoffes of a number of fooles, yet would I not willingly subiect my selfe to the confused iudgement of the senselesse vulgar, who commonly giue themselues most vnto the reading of such bookes. But that which most of all rid
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:173111:282"/> my hands, yea and my memorie of all desire to end it, was this argument, drawne from our moderne Comedies, and thus made to my selfe: If those, (as well the fictions, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical ones) are all or the most part of them notorious fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, and things without either head or foote, and yet are by the vulgar heard with such delight, and held and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for good: and both the Authors that compose them, and actors that represent them, say, that they must be such as they be for to please the peoples humors, and not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to reason or truth, and that because those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Decorum</hi> is obserued, and the fable followed according to the rules of Art, serue onely for three or foure discreete men <hi>(If so many may be found at a Play)</hi> which doe attend vnto them, and all the rest of the Auditours remaine fasting, by reason they cannot conceiue the artificiall contexture thereof; therefore is it better for them to gaine good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and meanes by many, then bare opinion or applause by a few. The very same would be the end of my Booke after I had vsed all possible industrie, to obserue the aforesaid precept; and I should remaine onely for a neede, and as the Taylour that dwels in a corner, without trade or estimation.</p>
               <p>And although I haue sundry times indeuoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Players that their opinion was erronious herein, and that they would attract more people and acquire grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fame by acting artificiall Comedies then those irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and methodicall Playes then vsed: yet are they so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their opinion, as no reason can wooe, nor demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion winne them from it. I remember how dealing vpon a day with one of those obstinate fellowes, I said vnto him: doe not you remember how a few yeeres agoe were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in <hi>Spaine</hi> three Tragedies, written by a famous Poet of our Kingdome, which were such as delighted, yea and amazed all the auditours as well the learned as the simple, the exact as the sleight ones; and that the Players got more by those three alone, then by thirtie of the best that were penned, or Acted since that time? You meane without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:173111:283"/> quoth the Actor answering mee, <hi>Isabella, Filis,</hi> and <hi>Alexandra.</hi> The very same quoth I; and note whether in them were not rightly obserued all the rules and precepts of Art, and yet thereby they neither wanted any part of their dignitie, nor the approbation of all the world. So that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the fault not to be in the vulgar that couets idle toyes, but rather in those which know not how to penne or Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, for no such fond stuffe was in the Comedie of <hi>Ingratitude reuenged:</hi> nor found in <hi>Numantia,</hi> nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in that of the <hi>Amorous Merchant,</hi> and much lesse in the <hi>Fauourable enemy,</hi> nor in some others made by iudicious Poets, which both redounded to their infinite fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, and yeelded vnto these Actors aboundant gaine. To these I added other reasons, wherewith I left him, in mine opinion, somewhat perplexed, but not satisfied, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to forgoe his erronious opinion.</p>
               <p>Truely M. <hi>Canon,</hi> quoth the <hi>Curate,</hi> you haue touched a matter that hath rowsed an ancient rancour and heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mine against the Comedies now in request; the which is equall to the grudge that I beare to Bookes of Knighthood. For seeing the Comedie as <hi>Tully</hi> affirmes ought to be a mirrour of mans life, a patterne of manners, and an Image of truth: Those that are now exhibited, are mirrours of vanitie, patternes of folly, and Images of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse. For what greater absurditie can be in such a subiect, then to see a child come out, in the first <hi>Scene</hi> of the first Act, in his swadling cloutes, and issue in the second already growne a man, yea a bearded man? And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vanitie then to present before vs, a valiant old man, and a young coward? A Lay man become a Diuine, a Page a Counsellour, a King a scoundrell, and a Princesse a scowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettle? What should I say, of the little care had of the due obseruation of time, for the succeeding of that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, other then that I my selfe haue seene Comedies, whose first Act began in <hi>Europe,</hi> the second in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the third ended in <hi>Africa,</hi> and truely if there had beene a fourth, it
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:173111:283"/> would questionlesse haue finished in <hi>America,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence we should haue seene a round walke about the foure parts of the world. And fayning an exployt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the time of King <hi>Pepin,</hi> or of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> they make the principall Actors thereof, either <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour that entred into <hi>Hierusalem</hi> bearing of the holy Crosse; or <hi>Godfree</hi> of <hi>Bulloin</hi> that recouered the Holy-land; Many yeeres, yea and ages hauing occurred betweene the times of the one and the other: yea and the Comedie being grounded on a fiction, to attribute vnto it the verities of a Historie, and mingle it and patch it vp, with peeces of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hauing relation to different persons, and times; and this with no plausible inuention, or draught resembling the truth, but rather with palpable, grosse, and inexcusable errours. And which is worse, some guls are found to affirme, that all perfection consists herein, and that they are too daintie that looke for any other.</p>
               <p>Now if wee would passe further to examine the diuine Comedies that treate of God, or the liues of Saints, what a multitude of false miracles doe the composers deuise? what a bulke of matters Apocriphall, and ill-vnderstood? attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one Saint the miracles done by another: yea and in humane Comedies they presume to doe miracles (without farther respect, or consideration, but that such a miracle or shew, as they terme it, would doe well in such a place) to the end that the ignorant folke may admire them, and come the more willingly to them: all which doth preiudice truth, discredit histories, and turne to the disgrace of our <hi>Spanish</hi> wits: for strangers which doe with much punctualitie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the method of Comedies, hold vs to be rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, when they see such follies, and absurdities escape vs: and it will be no sufficient excuse for this errour, to say, that the principall end of well gouerned Commonwealths, in the permitting of Comedies, is only to entertaine the Comunal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with some honest pastime, and thereby diuert the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and vicious humours which idlenesse is wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender:
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:173111:284"/> and seeing that this end is attained to by whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Comedies good or bad, it were to no purpose to appoint any lawes, or limits vnto them; or to tie the composers to frame, or actors to play them, as they should doe: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I answere, that this end would without all comparison be compassed, better by good Comedies then by euill ones: for the auditour, hauing heard an artificiall and well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Comedie, would come away delighted with the jests, &amp; instructed by the truths thereof: wondering at the successes, grow discreeter by the reasons, warned by the deceits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wise by others example, incensed against vice, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of vertue; al which affects a good Comedie should stirre vp in the hearers minde, were hee neuer so grosse or clownish: And it is of all impossibilities the most impossible, that a Comedie consisting of all these parts, should not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine, delight, satisfie, and content the mind much more, then another that should bee defectiue in any of them, as most of our now-a day Comedies bee. Nor are the Poets that pen them chiefly to be blamed for this abuse: for some of them know very well where the errour lurkes, and know also as well how to redresse it. But because that Comedies are become a vendible merchandize, they affirme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tell the plaine truth, that the players would not buy them, if they were of any other, then the accustomed kinde, and therefore the Poet indeauours to accommodate himselfe to the humour of the Player, who is to pay him for his labour, and that this is the truth may bee gathered by an infinite number of Comedies, which a most happy wit of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath composed, with such delicacy, so many good jests so elegant a verse, so excellent reasons, so graue sentences, and finally with so much eloquence, and such a loftinesse of stile, as hee hath filled the world with his fame: and yet by reason that hee was forced to accommodate himselfe to the Actors, all of them haue not arriued to the height of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which Arte requires. Others there are that write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iudgement, and with so little heede of what they do,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:173111:284"/> as after their workes haue once beene acted, the Players are constrained to run away and hide themselues, fearing to bee punished, as often they haue beene, for acting things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Prince, or scandalous to some families.</p>
               <p>All which inconueniences might be redressed, if there were some vnderstanding and discreet person ordained at the Court, to examine all Comedies before they were acted, and that not only such as were played at the Court it selfe, but also all others that were to be acted throughout <hi>Spaine,</hi> without whose allowance, vnder his hand and seale, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of no Towne should permit any Comedie to bee played: By which meanes the players would diligently send their plaies to the Court, and might boldly afterwards act them, and the composers would with more care and studie examine their labours; knowing that they should passe the strict censure of him that could vnderstand them: and by this meanes would good Comedies be written, and the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them most easily attained to, <hi>viz.</hi> the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people, the good opinion of <hi>Spanish</hi> wits, the profit and securitie of the players, and the sauing of the care that is now imployed in chastising their rashnesse. And if the same charge were giuen to this man, or to some other, to examine the bookes of Knighthood, which should be made hereafter, some of them doubtlesse would be put forth ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that perfection whereof you spoke but now: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching our language with the pleasing and pretious treasure of eloquence; and being an occasion that the old bookes would become obscure in the bright presence of those new ones published, for the honest recreation, not only of the idler sort, but also of those that haue more serious occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For it is not possible for the bow to continue still bent: nor can our humane and fraile nature sustaine it selfe long, without some helpe of lawfull recreation.</p>
               <p>The Canon and Curate had arriued to this point of their discourse, when the Barber spurring on, &amp; ouertaking them, said to the Curate, this is the place I lately told you was fit
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:173111:285"/> to passe ouer the heate of the day in, while the Oxen baited amidst the fresh and abundant pastures: it likes me very wel, quoth the Curate: and telling the Canon what he meant to doe, he also was pleased to remaine with them, as well inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the prospect of a beautifull vally, which offered it selfe to their view, as also to inioy the Curates conuersation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom he beganne to beare maruailous affection: and lastly with the desire hee had to bee throughly acquainted with <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> aduentures, therefore he gaue order to some of his men, that they should ride to the Inne, which was hard by, and bring from thence what meate they could finde sufficient to satisfie them all, because he likewise meant to passe the hot time of the day in that place: to which one of his men did answere, that their sumpture Mule was by that time, as he thought, in the Inne, so copiously furnished with prouision of meate, that as hee supposed, they needed not buy any thing there but barly for their Mules: if it bee so, quoth the Canon, let our Mules be carryed thither, and the sumpture one returned hither.</p>
               <p>Whilest this passed, <hi>Sancho</hi> being free from the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence of the Curate and Barber, whom he held as suspected persons, thought it a fit time to speake with his Lord, and therefore drew neare to the cage wherein he sate, and said to him in this manner. Sir, that I may discharge my conscience, I will reueale vnto you all that hath past in this affaire of your inchauntment: which briefly is, that those two which ride with their faces couered, are the Curate of our Village and the Barber, and as I imagine they both are the plotters of this your kinde of carrying away, for meere emulation that they see you surpasse them both in atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of famous acts. This truth being presupposed, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that you are not inchaunted, but bee gulled and made a foole. For the proofe whereof I will but demaund of you one question, and if you doe answere me according to mine expectation, as I beleeue you will, you shall feele the deceipt with your owne handes, and perceiue how you are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:173111:285"/> but rather haue your wits turned vpside-downe. Sonn <hi>Sancho</hi> demaund what thou wilt, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and I will satisfie thee, and answere directly to thy desire: But as touching thy auerment, that those which goe along with vs be the Curate, and Barber, our Gossips, and old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; it may well befall that they seeme to bee such; but that they are so really, and in effect, I would not haue thee beleeue in any manner. For that which thou art to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and shouldest vnderstand in this matter is, that if they be like those our friends as thou sayest, it must needs be that those which haue inchaunted mee, haue assumed their sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and likenesse (for it is an easie thing for Magicians to put on any shape they please) thereby to giue thee occasion to thinke that which thou doest, to driue thee into such a labyrinth of imaginations, as thou shalt not afterwards know how to sallie out, although thou hadst the assistance of <hi>Theseus</hi> clew: and withall to make me wauer in mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, to the end I may not coniecture from whence this charme is deriued vnto me: for if thou on the one side doest affirme, that the Barber, and Curate of our Village doe accompany me; and I on the other side finde my selfe inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and am so assured of mine owne force, that no humane strength bee it not supernaturall, is able thus to incage mee, what wouldest thou haue mee say, or thinke, but that the manner of mine inchantment exceeds as many as euer I read throughout all the Histories, intreating of Knights errant which haue beene inchaunted. Wherefore thou maiest very well appease, and quiet thy selfe in that point of beleeuing, then to be those thou saist; for they are those as much, as I am a Turke: and as touching thy desire to demaund some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of me, speake, for I will answere thee, although thou puttest me questions vntill to morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Our Ladie assist me quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> (as loude as he could) and is it possible that you are so brainsicke, and hard headed as you cannot perceiue that I affime the very pure truth, and that malice hath a greater stroake in this your disgrace, and
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:173111:286"/> imployment, then any inchantments. But seeing it is so, I will proue euidently that you are not inchanted: if not, tell me, as God shall deliuer you out of this tempest, and as you shall see your selfe, when you least thinke of it in my Ladie <hi>Dulcineas</hi> armes: make an end of coniuring mee, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and aske me what question thou wilt; for I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie told thee that I will answere with all punctuality: that is it I demaund quoth <hi>Sancho;</hi> and the thing I would know is, that you tell me without adding or diminishing ought, but with all truth vsed or looked for of all those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the exercise of armes as you doe, vnder the title of Knights errants? I say answered <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> that I will not lie a iot: make therefore a beginning, or an ende of his demaunds, for in good sooth thou dost weary me with so many salutations, petitions and preuentions? <hi>Sancho</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I say that I am secure of the bountie and truth of my Lord: and therefore, because it makes to the purpose in our affaire, I doe with all respect, demaund, whether your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship since your incagement, and as you imagine inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that coope, haue not had a desire to make greater or lesse water, as men are wont to say. I do not vnderstand good <hi>Sancho,</hi> that phrase of making water: and therefore explicate thy selfe if thou wouldest haue me to answere thee directly: and is it possible, replied he, that your worship vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not what it is to make great or little waters? then goe to some schoole, and learne it of the boyes, and know that I would say, haue you had a desire to doe that which cannot be vndone? O now, now, I vnderstand thee <hi>Sancho;</hi> yes verie many times, yea and euen now I haue, wherefore, I pray thee, deliuer mee from the extremitie thereof for I promise thee I am not altogether so cleane as I would be.</p>

                  <p>Wherein the discreete discourse that passed betweene <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Panca</hi> and his Lord <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>A, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> haue I caught you at last? this is that which I desired to know, as much as my soule or life. Come now Sir, and tell me, can you denie that which is wont to be said, when a bodie is ill disposed, I know not what ayles such a one; for hee neither eates nor drinkes, nor sleepes, nor answeres directly to that which is demaunded him, so as it seemes that he is inchanted? by which may be collected, that such as neither eate, drinke, sleepe, nor do the other naturall things you wote of are inchanted: but not those which haue a desire as you haue, and eate meate, when they get it, and drinke drinke when it is giuen them, and answere to all that is propounded vnto them? Thou sayest true <hi>Sancho</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote:</hi> but I haue told thee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that there are diuers sorts of inchantments, and perhaps they change with the times from one kinde into another; and that now the inchanted vse to doe all that which I doe, although they did not so in times past; and therefore there is no disputing or drawing of conclusions against the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the time. I know, and doe verily perswade my selfe, that I am inchanted, and that is sufficient for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my conscience, which would be greatly burdened if I thought that I were not inchanted, and yet permitted my selfe to be borne away in this Cage idlely, and like a coward withholding the succour I might giue to many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed and needie persons, which euen at this houre be like enough to haue extreame want of mine aide, and assistance. Yet say I notwithstanding replied <hi>Sancho,</hi> that for more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant satisfaction your worship might do wel to attempt
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:173111:287"/> the getting out of this prison, the which I do oblige my selfe with all my power to facilitate, yea and to get you out, and then you may recount eftsoons on the good <hi>Rozinante,</hi> who also seemes inchanted, so sad and melancholy he goes: And this being done, we may againe assay the fortune of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduentures, which if it haue no good successe, we haue time enough to returne to our Cage; wherein I promise, by the faith of a good and loyall Squire, to shut vp my selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with you, if you shall proue so vnfortunate, or I so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, as not to bring our designes to a good issue. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doe what thou sayest, brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and when thou seest oportunity offered to free me, I will be rated by thee in euery thing, but yet thou shalt see, how far thou art ouerwrought in the knowledge thou wilt seeme to haue of my disgrace.</p>
               <p>The Knight errant, and the ill errant Squire beguiled the time in these discourses, vntill they arriued vnto the place where the Canon, Curate, and Barber expected them; and then <hi>Sancho</hi> allighting, &amp; helping to take downe the Cage, the waineman vnyoaked his Oxen, permitting them to take the benefit of pasture in that greene and pleasant valley, whose verder inuited not such to inioyne it as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted like <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but rather such heedfull and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete persons as was his man, who intreated the <hi>Curate</hi> to licence his Lord to come out, but a little while, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the prison would not be so cleanly as the presence of so worthie a Knight as his Lord was required. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vnderstood his meaning, and answered that he would satisfie his request very willingly, but that hee feared that when he saw himselfe at liberty, he would play then some pranke or other, and goe whither no bodie should euer set eye on him after: I will be his surety that he shall not flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> and I also, quoth the Canon, if he wil but promise mee, as he is a knight, that he will not depart from vs without our consent. I giue my word that I will not, said <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> (who heard all that they had said) and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:173111:287"/> because that inchanted bodies haue not freewill to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of themselues as they list; for he that inchanted them, may make them vnable to stirre from one place in three daies: and if they make an escape, he can compell them to returne flying: and therefore since it was so, they might securely set him at liberty, especially seeing that it would redound so much to all their benefits: for if they did not free him, or get further off, he protested that he could not forbeare to offend their noses. The Canon tooke his hand (although it were bound) and by his faith, and word, that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and then they gaue him liberty; whereat he infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyced, especially seeing himselfe out of the Cage. The first thing that he did after was to stretch all his bodie, and then he went towards <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and striking him twice or thrice on the buttocks, he said: I hope yet in God, and his blessed mother: O flower and mirrour of horses, that wee two shall see our selues very soone in that state which our hearts desire; thou with thy Lord on thy backe, and I moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on thee, and exercising the function for which God sent mee into this world. And saying so, <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> with his Squire <hi>Sancho,</hi> retired himselfe somewhat from the companie, and came backe soone after a little more ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned, but greatly desiring to execute his Squires designes.</p>
               <p>The Canon beheld him very earnestly, and with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wondering to see the strangenesse of his fond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and how that he shewed, in whatsoeuer he vttered, a very good vnderstanding, and onely left the stirrops (as is said before) when any mention was made of Chiualrie; and therefore moued to compassion, after they were all laide downe along vpon the grasse, expecting their dinner, hee said vnto him: Gentlemen, is it possible that the idle and vnsauourie lecture of Bookes of Knighthood, hath so much distracted your wit, as thus to beleeue, that you are caried away inchanted, with other things of that kind, as much wide from truth, as vntruths can be from veritie it selfe? Or how is it possible that any humaine vnderstanding can frame
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:173111:288"/> it selfe to beleeue, that in this world there haue beene such an infinitie of <hi>Amadises,</hi> such a crew of famous Knights, so many Emperours of <hi>Trabisonda,</hi> such a number of <hi>Felix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi> of <hi>Hyrcania;</hi> so many Palfrayes, Damzels errant, Serpents, Robbers, Giants, Battailes, vnheard of aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, sundrie kinds of inchantments, such vnmeasurable in Counters, such brauerie of apparell, such a multitude of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured and valiant Princesses, so many Squires-Earles, wittie Dwarfes, Viragoes, Loue letters, amorous dallian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and finally so many, so vnreasonable, and impossible aduentures, as are contained in the Bookes of Knighthood. This much I dare auouch of my selfe, that when I read them as long as I doe not thinke that they are all but toyes and vntruthes, they delight me: but when I ponder seriously, what they are, I throw the very best of them against the wals, yea and would throw them into the fire if they were neere me, or in my hands. Hauing well deserued that seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as false Impostures, and seducers of common sence; as broachers of new Sects, and of vncouth courses of life; as those that giue occasion to the ignorant vulgar to beleeue in, such exorbitant vntruthes as are contained in rhem. Yea, and are withall so presumptuous, as to dare to confound the wits of the most discreete, and best discended Gentlemen; as we may clearely perceiue by that they haue done to your selfe, whom they haue brought to such termes as it is necessarie to shut you vp in a Cage, and carie you on a Teame of Oxen, euen as one caries a Lion or Tygre from place to place, to gaine a liuing by the shewing of him. Therefore, good <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> take compassion of your selfe, and returne into the bosome of discretion; and learne to imploy the most happie talent of vnderstanding, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wit, wherewith bountifull heauen hath inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, yet some other course of studie, which may redound to the profit of your soule, and aduancement of your credit and estate. And if, borne away by your naturall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you will yet persist in the reading of warlike, &amp; Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:173111:288"/> discourses; Reade in the holy Scripture the Acts of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for there you shall find surpassing feates and deedes, as true, as valorous. <hi>Portugall</hi> had a <hi>Viriate. Rome</hi> a <hi>Caesar. Carthage</hi> an <hi>Hannibal, Greece</hi> an <hi>Alexander, Castile</hi> an Earl, <hi>Fernan Goncalez, Valencia</hi> a <hi>Cid, Andaluzia</hi> a <hi>Goncalo Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez, Estremaduza</hi> a <hi>Diego Garcia de Paredes, Xerez</hi> a <hi>Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo</hi> a <hi>Garci Lasso, Siuil</hi> a <hi>Don Manuel de Leon,</hi> The discourses of whose valorous Actes, may entertaine, teach, delight, and make wonder, the most sublime wit that shall reade them. Yea, this were indeed a studie fit for your sharpe vnderstanding, my deere Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> for by this you should become learned in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, enamoured of vertue, instructed in goodnesse, bettered in maners, valiant without rashnesse, bold without cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: and all this to Gods honour, your owne profit, and renowme of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> from whence, as I haue learned, you deduce your beginning and progenie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> listned with all attention vnto the Canons admonition, and perceiuing that he was come to an end of them, after he had looked vpon him a good while, he said, me thinkes Gentleman, that the scope of your discourse hath beene addrest to perswade me, that there neuer were any Knights Errant in the world; and that all the bookes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie are false, lying, hurtfull, and vnprofitable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and that I haue done ill to reade them, worse to beleeue in them, and worst of all to follow them, by hauing thus taken on mee the most austere profession of wandring Knighthood, where of they intreate: denying moreouer that there were euer any <hi>Amadises,</hi> either of <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Greece;</hi> or any of all the other Knights, wherewith such Bookes are stuffed; All is iust as you haue said, quoth the <hi>Canon:</hi> whereto <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replied thus, You also added, that such Bookes had done me much hurt, seeing they had turned my iudgement, and immured me vp in this Cage; and that it were better for me, to make some amendment, and alter my studie, reading other that are more authenticall,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:173111:289"/> and delight and instruct much better. It is very true answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Canon. Why then, quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> I finde by mine accounts, that the inchanted, and senslesse man is your selfe; seeing you haue bent your selfe to speak so many blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies against a thing so true, so currant, and of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest in the world, as hee that should denie it, as you doe, merites the same punishment, which as you say you giue to those Bookes, when the reading thereof offends you: For to goe about to make men beleeue, that <hi>Amadis</hi> neuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; nor any other of those Knights, wherewith Histories are fully replenished, would bee none other then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, that the Sunne lightens not, the Earth sustaines not, nor the Ice makes any thing cold. See what witte is there in the world so profound, that can induce another to beleeue, that the Historie of <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Floripes,</hi> was not true? Nor that of <hi>Fierabras,</hi> with the bridge of <hi>Mantible,</hi> which befell in <hi>Charlemaines</hi> time, and is, I sweare, as true, as that it is day at this instant; and if it be a lie, so must it bee also, that euer there was an <hi>Hector Achilles,</hi> or the warre of <hi>Troy; The twelue Peeres of France,</hi> or King <hi>Arthur of Brittaine,</hi> who goes yet about the world in the shape of a Crow, and is euery foote expected in his Kingdome. And they will as well presume to say, that the Historie of <hi>Guarino Mezquino,</hi> and of the quest of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Sangriall</hi> be lies; and that for the loue betweene Sir <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram</hi> and <hi>La Belle Ysonde,</hi> and betweene Queene <hi>Gueneuor</hi> and Sir <hi>Launcelot Dulak,</hi> we haue no sufficient Authoritie, and yet there bee certaine persons aliue, which almost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that they haue seene the Lady <hi>Quintaniona,</hi> who was one of the best skinkers of Wine that euer Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> had; and this is so certaine, as I remember that one of my Grandmothers of my Fathers side, was wont to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, when shee saw my matrone, with a long and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend kerchiefe or vaile, my boy, that woman resembles very much Lady <hi>Quintaniona,</hi> from which I argue, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shee knew her selfe, or at the least, had seene some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:173111:289"/> of hers. Who can moreouer denie the certaintie of the Historie of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Prouaunce,</hi> and the beautifull <hi>Magolona,</hi> seeing that vntill this very day one may behold in the Kings Armorie, the Pinne wherewith he guided, and turned any way he listed, the Horse of wood, whereupon he rode thorow the Ayre; which Pinne, is a little bigger then the Thill of a Cart, and neere vnto it is also seene <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieca</hi> his saddle: and in <hi>Roncesuals</hi> there yet hangs <hi>Rowlands</hi> hornes, which is as bigge as a very great Ioyst, whence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that there were twelue Peeres, that there was a <hi>Pierres</hi> of <hi>Prouance,</hi> that also there were <hi>Cides,</hi> and other such Knights as those which the world termes aduenturers; if not, let them also tell me, that the valiant <hi>Lusitanian, Iohn de Melo,</hi> was no Knight Errant, who went to <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and in the Citie of <hi>Ras</hi> fought with the famous Lord of <hi>Charni</hi> called <hi>Mosen Pierres,</hi> and after with <hi>Mosen Henry</hi> of <hi>Ramestan</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Basilea,</hi> and bore away the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie in both the conflicts, to his eternall fame: and that there were no such curres as the aduentures, and single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats begunne, and ended in <hi>Burgundie,</hi> by the valiant Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards <hi>Pedro Barba,</hi> and <hi>Gutierre Quixada</hi> (from whom I my selfe am lineally discended) who ouercame the Earle of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> sonnes. They may also auerre vnto me, that <hi>Don Fernando de Gueuarra</hi> went not to seeke aduentures in <hi>Germanie,</hi> where he fought with <hi>Micer George</hi> a Knight of the Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> his house: Let them likewise affirme, that <hi>Suero de Quinonnes</hi> of the passage, his Iustes were but iestes; as also the enterprise of <hi>Mosen Lewis de falses,</hi> against <hi>Don Goncala de Guzman</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Castile,</hi> with many other renoumed Acts, done as well by <hi>Christian</hi> Knights of this Kingdome, as of other forraine lands, and so authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and true, as that I am compelled to reiterate what I said before, that whosoeuer denies them, is defectiue of reason and good discourse.</p>
               <p>Full of admiration remained the good Canon, to heare the composition, and medly, that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> made of
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:173111:290"/> truths, and fictions together; and at the great notice he had of all things that might any way concerne his Knighthood errant: and therefore he shaped him this answere: I cannot denie Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> but that some part of that which you haue said is true, specially touching those <hi>Spanish</hi> aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of whome you haue spoken; and will likewise graunt you, that there were twelue Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> but I will not beleeue that they haue accomplished all that which the <hi>Archbishop Turpine</hi> hath left written of them: for the bare truth of the affaire is, that they were certaine Noblemen chosen out by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> whom they called <hi>Peeres,</hi> because they were all equall in valour, qualitie, and worth; or if they were not, it was at least presumed that they were; and they were not much vnlike the militarie orders of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> or <hi>Calatraua,</hi> were in request, wherein it is presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that such as are of the profession, are, or ought to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, and well descended, Gentlemen: and as now they say, a Knight of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or <hi>Alcantara,</hi> so in those times they said, a Knight of the twelue <hi>Peeres;</hi> because they were twelue equals, chosen to be of that military order. That there was a <hi>Cid,</hi> and a <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Carpio,</hi> is also doubtlesse; that they haue done the acts recounted of them, I beleeue there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great cause to doubt. As touching the pinne of the good Earle <hi>Pierres,</hi> and that it is by <hi>Babicca</hi> his saddle in the kings Armourie, I confesse that my sin hath made me so ignorant, or blind, that although I haue the saddle very well, yet could I neuer get a sight of that Pinne, how great soeuer you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to bee. Well, it is there without question, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and for the greater confirmation thereof they say it is laid vp in a case of Neates leather, to keepe it from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="571" facs="tcp:173111:290"/> that so Honorable a man, adorned with so many good parts, and indowed with such a wit, as you are, should beleeue, that so many, and so strange follies, as are written in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bookes of Chiualrie, can be true.</p>

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:173111:291"/> exquisite workemanship, as although the materials whereof it is built, are no worse then <hi>Diamonds, Carbuncles, Rubies, Emeralds, Pearles,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> yet is the Architecture thereof of more estimation &amp; value then they, and is there any more to be seene, after the seeing hereof, then to see sallie out at the Castle gates, a goodly troupe of louely Damzels, whose braue and costly attyre, if I should attempt to describe as it is laid downe in Histories, wee should neuer make an end? and shee that seemes the chiefest of all to take presently our bold Knight, that threw himselfe into the boiling lake, by the hand, and carry him into the rich Castle or Palace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking a word, and cause him to strip himselfe as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as he was when his Mother bore him, and bathe him in very temperate waters, and afterward annoint him all ouer with precious ointments, and put on him a shirt of most fine, odoriferous, and perfumed Sendall; and then another Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell to come suddainely, and casts on his backe a rich mantel, which they say is wont to bee worth, at the very least a rich City, yea and more? then what a sport it is, when they tell vs after, that after this hee is carried into another Hall, where he finds the tables couered so orderly as he rests ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? what, to see cast on his hands water distilled all of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, and most fragrant flowers? what, to see him seated in a chaire of Yuorie? what, to see him serued by all the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels with maruailous silence? what, the fetting before him such variety of accates, and those so excellently dressed, as his appetite knowes not to which of them it shall first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse his hand? what, to heare the Musicke which sounds whilst he is at dinner, without knowing who makes it, or whence it comes? and after that dinner is ended, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles taken away, the Knight to remaine leaning on a chaire, and perhaps picking of his teeth, as the custome is, and on a suddaine to enter at the Hal-dore another much more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Damzell then any of the former, and to fit by his side and beginne to recount vnto him what Castle that is, and how shee is inchaunted therein, with many other things that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:173111:292"/> the Knight, and amazed the Readers. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my selfe any more in this matter, seeing that you may collect out of that which I haue said, that any part that is read of any booke of a Knight errant, will delight, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him, that shall peruse it with attention: and therefore I pray you beleeue me, &amp; as I haue said already, reade those kinde of bookes, and you shall finde that they will exile all the melancholie that shall trouble you, and rectifie your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, if by fortune it be depraued: for I dare affirme of my selfe that since I am become a Knight errant, I am vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, curteous, liberall, well mannered, generous, gentle, bold, mild, patient, an indurer of labours, imprisonments, and inchauntments: and although it be but so little a while since I was shut vp in a cage like a mad man, yet doe I hope by the valour of mine arme (heauen concurring and fortune not crossing me) to see my selfe within a few dayes, the King of some Kingdome, wherein I may shew the bounty and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie included within my brest. For in good truth Sir, a poore man is made vnable to manifest the vertue of libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie towards any other, although he virtually possesse it himselfe in a most eminent degree: and the will to gratifie which only consists of will, is as dead a thing, as Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Workes. For which cause I doe wish, that fortune would quickly present me some occasion whereby I might make my selfe an Emperour; that I may discouer the desire I haue to doe good vnto my friends, but especially to this my poore Squire <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who is one of the honestest men in the world, on whome I would faine bestow the Earledome which I promised him many dayes past, but that I feare mee he will not be able to gouerne his state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> ouerhearing those last words of his masters said, labour you, Sir <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> to gette mee that Earledome as often promised by you, as much longed for by me, and I promise you that I will not want sufficiency to gouerne it, and though I should, yet haue I heard say, that there are men in the world who take Lordships to farme, paying the Lord
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:173111:292"/> so much by the yeare, and vndertaking the care of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment thereof, whilst the Lord himselfe with outstret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched legs doth liue at his ease; enioying the rents they bring him, and caring for nothing else: and so will I doe, and will not stand racking it to the vtmost, but presently desist from all administration, and liue merrily vpon my rent like a yong Duke; and so let the world wagge, and goe how it will. That friend <hi>Sancho</hi> is to be vnderstood quoth the Canon, of enioyning the reuenewes; but as concerning the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of iustice, the Lord of the Signiory is bound to looke to it, in that is required a sufficiency and ability to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and aboue all, a good intention to deale iustly, and determine rightly: for if this be wanting when we beginne, our meanes and ends will alwaies be subiect to errour. And therefore is God wont as well to further the good designes of the simple, as to disfauour the bad ones of those that be wittily wicked.</p>
               <p>I vnderstand not those Philosophies quoth <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> but this I know well, that I would I had as speedily the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as I could tell how to gouerne it, for I haue as much soule as another, and as much bodie as hee that hath most, and I would be as absolute a king in my estate, as any one would be in his; and being such, I would doe what I liked, and doing what I liked, I would take my pleasure, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my pleasure I would be content; and when one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he hath no more to desire, and hauing no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the matter were ended: and then come the state when it will, or farewell it, and let vs behold our selues, as one blinde man said to another. They are no bad Philosophies which thou comest out with kind <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth the Canon, but yet for all that there is much to be said concerning this matter of Earledomes. To that <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> replied: I know not what more may be said, onely I gouerne my selfe by the the example of <hi>Amadis de Saule,</hi> who made his Squire Earle of the firme Iland: and therefore I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scruple of conscience make <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> an Earle; for
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:173111:293"/> he is one of the best Squires that euer knight errant had. The Canon abode amazed at the well-compacted and orderly rauings of <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> at the manner wherewith he had deciphered the aduenture of the Knight of the lake; at the impression which his lying bookes had made into him: and finally he wondred at the simplicitie of <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> who so earnestly desired to be made Earle of the county his Lord had promised him.</p>
               <p>By this time the Canons seruingmen, which had gone to the Inne for the sumpture Mule, were returned, and making their table of a carpet, and of the greene grasse of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, they sate downe vnder the shadow of the trees, and did eate there, to the end that the waineman might not lose the commoditie of the pasture, as we haue said before, and as they sate at dinner, they sodainly heard the sound of a little bell issuing from among the briars and brambles that were at hand, and instantly after they saw come out of the thicket a very faire she-Goate, whose hide was poudered all ouer with blacke, white, and browne spots: after her followed a Goatheard crying vnto her, and in his language bidding her stay, or returne againe to the fould: but the fugitiue Goate all affrighted and fearefull ranne towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and as it were seeking in her dumbe manner to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, strayed neere vnto them, then did the Goatheard ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue, and laying hold of her hornes (as if shee had beene capable of his reprehension) said vnto her. O yee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ape, ye spotted else, how come you to halt with me a late daies? what wolues do skarre your daughter? will you not tell me, faire, what the matter is? but what can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that you are a female, and therefore can neuer be quiet, a foule euill take your conditions, and all theirs, whom you so much resemble, turne backe loue, turne backe, and though you be not so content withall, yet shall you at least be more safe in your fold, and among the rest of your fellowes: for if you that shall guide and direct them, go thus distracted, and wandering, what then must they doe, what
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:173111:293"/> will become of them? The Goatheards words did not a little delight the hearers, but principally the Canon, who said vnto him, I pray thee good fellow take thy rest heere a while, and doe not hasten that Goate so much to her fould, for seeing she is a female, as thou sayest, she will follow her naturall instinct how much soeuer thou opposest thy self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: take therefore that bit, and drinke a draught where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall thou maist temper thy choller, and the Goate will rest her the whilst: and saying so, hee gaue him the hinder quarter of a cold Rabbet, which he receiuing, rendred him many thankes, and drinking a draught of wine, did pacifie himselfe, and said presently after: I would not haue you my masters account me simple, although I spoke to this beast in so earnest a fashion; for in truth the words which I vsed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her were not without some mysterie. I am indeed rustick, and yet not so much, but that I know how to conuerse with men, and with beasts. I beleeue that easily quoth the Curate, for I know alreadie by experience, that the woods breede learned men, and sheepe coats containe Philosophers. At the least Sir, replied the Goatheard, they haue among them experienced men: and that you may giue the more credite to this truth, and as it were, touch it with your owne hands, (although till I be bidden, I may seeme to inuite my selfe) I will, if you please to heare me but a while, relate vnto you a very true accident, which shall make good what this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (pointing to the Curate) and my selfe haue affirmed, to this <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> answered, because the Case doth seeme to haue in it some shadow of knightly aduentures, I will for my part listen vnto thee with a very good will, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that all these Gentlemen will doe the like, so great is their discretion, and desire to know curious nouelty which amaze, delight, and entertaine the senses, as I doe certainly beleeue thy history will. Therefore begin it friend, and all of vs wil lend our eares vnto it, I except mine quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> for I will goe with this pastie vnto that little streame, where I meane to fill my selfe for three daies; for I haue heard my
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:173111:294"/> Lord <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> say, that a Knight errants Squire must eate when he can, and alwaies as much as he can, because that oftentimes they enter by chance into some wood so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, as they cannot get out of it againe in fiue or sixe daies: and if a mans panch be not then well stuffed, or his wallet well stored, he may there remaine, and be turned as many times it happens, into mummie. Thou art in the right of it <hi>Sancho,</hi> quoth <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> goe therefore where thou wilt, and eate what thou maist, for I am alreadie satisfied, and onely want refection for my minde, which now I will giue it by listening to this good follow. The same will wee also giue vnto ours quoth the Canon, who therewithall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Goatheard to keepe promise, and beginne his tale. Then he stroking once or twice his prettie Goate, (which he yet held fast by the hornes) said thus: Lye downe pide foole, by mee, for we shall haue time enough to returne home againe. It seemed that the Goat vnderstood him; for as soone as her master sate downe, she quietly stretched her selfe along by him, and looking him in the face, did giue to vnderstand, that she was attentiue to what hee was saying. And then he began his history in this manner.</p>

<pb n="597" facs="tcp:173111:294"/> wealth he possessed: But that which did most accumulate his happinesse (as he himselfe was wont to say) was, that he had a daughter of so accomplished beauty, so rare discretion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and vertue, that as many as knew and beheld her, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired to see the passing indowments wherewith heauen, and nature had inriched her. Being a child she was fayre, &amp; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing daily in feature, she was at the age of sixteen most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The fame wherof extended it selfe ouer all the bordering villages, but why say I the bordring villages alone, if it spread it self ouer the farthest cities, yea &amp; entred into the kings Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, &amp; into the eares of all kinde of people? so that they came from all parts to behold her as a rare thing, and patterne of miracles? her father did carefully keepe her, and she likewise heeded her selfe: for there is neither guard, locke, nor bolt able to keepe a mayden better, then is her owne warinesse, and care. The wealth of the father, and worth of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter moued diuers, as well of his owne village as strangers, to demaund her to wife, but he (as one whom the disposall of so rich a iewell most neerely concerned) was much perplexed, and vnable to determine on whom, among such an infinite number of importunate woers, he might bestow her: among others that bore this good wil towards her, I my self was one to whom gaue many, and very great hopes of good successe, the knowledge that her father had of mee, my birth in the same village, my descent honest, and blood vntainted, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in yeares, very rich in goods, and no lesse in gifts of the mind. Another of the same village, and qualities was also a suiter vnto her: which was an occasion to hold her in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence, and put his will in the ballance, deeming as he did, that she might be bestowed on either of vs two: and that he might be rid of his doubt, he resolued to tell it to <hi>Leandra,</hi> (for so do they call the rich maids which hath brought mee to extreame misery) noting discreetly, that seeing we both were equals, it would not be amisse to leaue in his deere daughters power the making choyce of whether she liked best. <hi>A thing worthy to be noted by all those parents that would

I know not what was the liking of <hi>Leandra,</hi> but only know this, that the father po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vs off by alleaging the ouer greene yeares of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vsing generall termes, which neither obliged him, nor discharged vs. My riuall was called <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and my selfe <hi>Eugenio:</hi> that you may also haue some iustice of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which were actors in this tragedie, whose conclusion is yet depending, but threatens much future disaster.</p>
               <p>About the very same time arriued to our village one <hi>Ʋin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Rose,</hi> sonne to a poore labourer of the same place, which <hi>Vincente</hi> returned as then from <hi>Italy,</hi> and diuers other countries, wherin he had beene a souldier, for being of some twelue yeares of age, a certaine Captaine that with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany passed along by our village, did carry him away with him, and the youth after a dozen yeares more, came backe againe attired like &amp; a soldier, painted with a hundred co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, full of a thousand deuises of Cristall, fiue steele chains: to day he would put on some gay thing, the next day some other, but all of them slight painted, and of little waight, lesse worth. The clownish people which are naturally mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and if they haue but euer so little idlenesse or leasure become malice it selfe, did note and recken vp all his braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and iewels, and found that he had but three suits of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell of different colours, with garters and stockings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to them; but he vsed so many disguisements, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, transformations, and inuentions, which they, as if they had not counted them all, some one would haue sworne that he had made shew of more then tenne suits of apparrell, and more then twenty plumes of feathers: and let not that which I tell you of the apparrell be counted impertinent, or from the matter; for it makes a principall part in the history. He would sit on a bench that stood vnder a great Poplar tree in the midst of the market place, and there would hold vs all,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:173111:295"/> with gaping mouthes, listening to the gallant aduentures, and resolute acts he recounted vnto vs, there was no land in all the world, whose soile he had not troden on, no battell wherein he had not been present, he had slaine more <hi>Moores,</hi> then the kingdomes of <hi>Marrocco,</hi> and <hi>Tuney</hi> contained, and vndertaken more single combats, as he said, then euer did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gant, Luna,</hi> or <hi>Diego Garcia de Paredes,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand others whom he named, and yet hee still came away with the victory, without hauing euer left one drop of blood. On the other side he would shew vs signes of wounds, which although they could not be discerned, yet would he perswade vs that they were the markes of bullets, which he receiued in diuers skirmishes, and manners. Finally he would thou his equals, and those which knew him very well with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous arrogancy: and said, that his arme was his father, his workes his linage, and that beside his being a souldier, hee ought not a whit to the king. To these his arrogancies was annext some superficiall skill in musicke, for he could scratch a little on a Gytterne, and some would say that hee made it speake: but his many graces made not a stop there; for hee had likewise some shadowes of Poetry, and so would make a ballade of a league and a halfe long vpon euery toy that hapned in the village.</p>
               <p>The souldier therefore, whom I haue deciphered, this <hi>Ʋincente</hi> of the Rose, this braggard, this Musician, this Poet, eyed and beheld many times by <hi>Leandra</hi> from a certaine window of her house that looked into the Market place; and the golden shew of his attire enamoured her: and his Ditties inchanted her; for hee would giue twentie Copies of euery one he composed: The report of his worthy acts, beautified by himselfe, came also vnto her eares, and finally (for so it is likely the Diuell had ordered the matter) shee became in Loue with him before he presumed to thinke once of solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her. And as in Loue aduentures no one is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with more facilitie, then that which is fauoured by the womans desire; <hi>Leandra</hi> and <hi>Vincente</hi> made a short and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:173111:296"/> agreement, and ere any one of her suiters could once suspect her desires, shee had fully satisfied them; abandoned her deere and louing Fathers house, (for her mother liues not) and running away from the Village with the Souldier, who departed with more triumph from that enterprise, then from all the others which he had arrogated to himselfe. The accident amazed all the Towne, yea and all those to whome the rumour thereof arriued, was astonished, <hi>Anselmo</hi> ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, her father sorrowfull, her kinsfolke ashamed. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Iustice carefull, and the Troupers readie to make pursuit; all the wayes were laide, and the woods, and euery other place meerely searched; and at the end of three dayes they found the lustfull <hi>Leandra</hi> hidden in a Caue within a wood, naked in her smocke, and dispoyled of a great summe of money, and many precious Iewels, which shee had brought away with her: they returned her to her dolefull fathers presence, where asking how shee became so despoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, shee presently confessed, that <hi>Vincent</hi> of the Rose had deceiued her; for hauing passed his word to make her his wife, he perswaded her to leaue her fathers house, and made her beleeue that he would carrie her to the richest, and most delightfull Citie of the world, which was <hi>Naples.</hi> And that shee through indiscretion, and his fraude, had giuen credit to his words, and robbing her father, stole away with him the very same night that shee was missed; and that he caried her to a very rough thicket, and shut her vp in that Caue wherein they found her: Shee also recounted how the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, without touching her honour, had robd her of all that shee caried, and leauing her in that Caue, was fled away; which successe stroke vs into greater admiration then all the rest: for we could hardly be induced to beleeue the yong gallants continencie, but shee did so earnestly protest it, as it did not a little comfort her comfortlesse father, who made no reckoning of the riches hee had lost, seeing his daughter had yet reserued that Iewell which being once gone, could neuer againe be recouered. The same day that <hi>Leandra</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:173111:296"/> shee also vanished out of our sights, being conueied away by her Father, and shut vp in a Nunnerie at a certaine Towne not farre off; hoping that time would illiterate some part of the bad opinion already conceiued of his daughters facilitie. <hi>Leandra</hi> her youth serued to excuse her errour, at least with those which gained nothing by her being good or ill; but such as knew her discretion, and great wit, did not attribute her sinne to ignorance, but rather to her too much lightnesse, and the naturall infirmitie of that sexe, which for the most part is inconsiderate, and slipperie. <hi>Leandra</hi> being shut vp, <hi>Anselmos</hi> eyes lost her light, or at least beheld not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that could delight them; and mine remained in darknesse without light, that could addresse them to any pleasing obiect in <hi>Leandraes</hi> absence. Our griefes increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, our patience diminished, wee cursed the Souldiers orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abhord her Fathers want of looking to her. To be briefe, <hi>Anselmo</hi> and my selfe, resolued to abandon the Village, and come to this valley, where hee feeding a great flocke of Sheepe of his owne, and I as copious a Heard of Goates of mine, we passe our liues among these trees giuing vent to our passions, either by singing together the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Leandraes</hi> praises, or dispraises: or by sighing alone, and alone communicating our quarrelsome complaints with heauen. Many others of <hi>Leandras</hi> suitors haue since, by our example, come to these intricate woods, where they vse our very exercise; &amp; they are so many, as it seemes that this place is conuerted into the Pastoral <hi>Arcadia,</hi> it is ful of shepheards and sheepfolds, and there is no one part thereof wherein the name of the beautifull <hi>Leandra</hi> resoundeth not: There one doth curse her, and termeth her humours inconstant and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest an other condemnes her of being so facile and light; some one absolues, and pardons him, an other condemnes and dispises her, and celebrates her beautie, an other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates her disposition, and finally all blame, but yet adore her, and the rauing distraction of them all, doth so farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it selfe, as some one complaines of disdaine, that neuer
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:173111:297"/> spoke word vnto her, and some one laments, and feeles the inraged fits of iealousie, though shee neuer ministred any occasion thereof; for as I haue said her sinne was knowne before her desires; There is no clift of a Rocke, no banke of a streame, nor shadow of a tree without some Shepheard or other, that breathes out his misfortunes to the silent ayre. The <hi>Eccho</hi> repeates <hi>Leandras</hi> name, wheresoeuer it can bee formed; the woods resound <hi>Leandra,</hi> the brokes doe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur <hi>Leandra,</hi> and <hi>Leandra</hi> holds vs all perplexed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, hoping without hope, and fearing without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what we feare.</p>
               <p>And among all this flocke of franticke men none shewes more, or lesse iudgement, then my companion <hi>Anselmo;</hi> who hauing so many other titles vnder which hee might plaine him, onely complaines of absence, and doeth to the sound of a rebecke (which he handles admirably well) sing certaine dolefull verses, which fully discouer the excellencie of his conceit. I follow a more easie, and (in mine opinion) a more certaine way; to wit, I rayle on the lightnes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, on their inconstancie, double dealing, dead promises, crackt trust, and the small discretion they shewe in placing of their affections, and this Sir was the occasion of the words, and reasons I lately vsed to this Goate, whom I doe esteeme but little because shee is a female, although shee be otherwise, the best of all my heard: And this is the Historie which I promised to tell you, wherein if I haue beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe, I will bee altogether as large in doing you any seruice, for I haue here at hand my Cabine, and therein store of fresh milke, and sauory cheese, with many sortes of excellent fruite, no lesse agreeable to the sight then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the taste.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the falling out of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> and the Goateheard: with the aduenture of the disciplinants, to which the Knight gaue end to his cost.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Goateheards tale bred a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all the hearers, but specially in the Canon, who did very exactly note the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherewithall he deliuered it, as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the stile or discourse of a rude Goateheard, as approching to the discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a perfect Courtier; and therefore he said, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate had spoken very iudiciously, in affirming that the woods bred learned men, all of them made bountifull tenders of their friendship and seruice to <hi>Eugenio,</hi> but hee that enlarged himselfe more then the rest, was <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> who said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: certes, friend Goateheard, if I were at this time able to vndertake any aduenture, I would presently set forward, and fall in hand with it to doe you a good turne, and I would take <hi>Leandra</hi> out of the Monasterie (wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt shee is restrained against her will) in despight of the Ladie Abbesse, and of all those that should take her part; and would put her into your hands, to the end you might dispose of her at your pleasure, yet still obseruing the lawes of Knighthood, which command, that no man doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong, and offer violence vnto a Damzell: yet I hope in our Lord God, that the skill of a malicious inchaunter shall not be of such force, but that the science of a better meaning wisard shall preuaile against him; and whensoeuer that shal befall, I doe promise you my help and fauour, as I am bound by my profession, which chiefly consists in assisting the weake and distressed.</p>
               <p>The Goateheard beheld him, and seeing the Knight so ill arrayed, and of so euill-fauoured a countenance, hee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and questioned the Barber, who sate neare to him, thus
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:173111:298"/> I pray you Sir, who is this man, of so strange a figure, and that speaks so odly? who else should he be, answered the Barber, but the famous <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> the righter of wrongs, the redresser of iniuries, the protector of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, the affrighter of Giants, and the ouercommer of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails? that which you say of this man, answered the Goate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, is very like that which in bookes of Chiualrie is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Knights errant; who did all those things which you apply to this man: and yet I beleeue that either you iest, or else that this Gentlemans head is voide of braines. Thou art a great villaine, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and thou art hee whose pate wants braines; for mine is fuller then the very, very whoores that bore thee; and saying so, and snatching vp a loafe of bread that stoode by him, he caught the Goateheard so furious a blow withall, as it beate his nose flat to his face: but the other, who was not acquainted with such iests, and saw how ill hee was handled, without hauing respect to the Carpet, Napkins, or those that were eating, he leaped vpon <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and taking hold of his collar with both the hands, would certainely haue strangled him, <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> had not arriued at that very instant, and taking him fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, had not throwen him backe on the Table, crushing dishes, breaking glasses, and shedding, and ouerthrowing all that did lie vpon it. <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> seeing himselfe free retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to get vpon the Goateheard, who all besmeered with bloud, and trampled to peeces vnder <hi>Sanchos</hi> feete, groped here and there groueling as hee was for some knife or other to take a bloudy reuenge withall, but the Canon &amp; Curate preuented his purpose; and yet, by the Barbers assistance, he got vnder him <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> on whome hee rained such a shower of buffets, as hee powred as much bloud from the poore Knights face, as had done from his owne: the Canon and Curate were ready to burst for laughter: The Troupers danced for sport; euery one hissed, as men vse to doe when Dogges fall out, and quarrell together: only <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> was wood, because he could not get from one of the Canons
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:173111:298"/> Seruingmen, who with-held him from going to helpe his Master. In conclusion, all being very merry, saue the two buffetants, that tugged one another extremly, they heard the sound of a trumpet so dolefull, as it made them turne their faces towards that part from whence it seemed to come: but hee that was most troubled at the noise thereof was <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> who although he was vnder the Goateheard, full sore against his will, and by him exceedingly bruised and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet said vnto him: brother Diuell (for it is impossible that thou canst bee any other, seeing that thou hast had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour &amp; strength to subiect my forces) I pray thee let vs make truce, for one only houre; for the dolorous sound of that trumpet which toucheth our eares, doth, mee thinks inuite me to some new aduenture. The Goatheard, who was weary of buffetting, and being beaten, left him off incontinently, and <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> stood vp, and turned himselfe towards the place from whence he imagined the noise to proceede, and presently he espyed descending from a certaine height many men apparelled in white like disciplinants. The matter indeed was, that the clowdes had that yeere denyed to beflow their due on the earth, and therefore they did institute Rogations, Processions, and Disciplines, throughout all that Countrey, to desire almighty God to open the hands of his mercy, and to bestow some raine vpon them: and to this effect the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Village, neere vnto that place, came in Procession to a deuout Eremitage builded vpon one of the hilles that inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned that Vally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> noting the strange attyre of the Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, without any calling to memorie how hee had often seen the like before, did forthwith imagine that it was some new aduenture, and that the triall thereof only appertained to him, as to a Knight errant; and this his presumption was fortified the more, by beleeuing that an Image which they carried all couered ouer with blacke, was some principall Lady whom those miscreants and discourteous Knights did beare away perforce. And as soone as this fell into his brain,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:173111:299"/> he leaped lightly towards <hi>Rozinante,</hi> that went feeding vp and downe the plaines, and dismounting from his pomell the bridle, and his target that hanged thereat, hee bridled him in a twice; and taking his sword from <hi>Sancho,</hi> got instantly vpon his horse, and then embracing his target, said in a loude voice to all those that were present: you shall now see, O va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous company, how important a thing it is to haue in the world such Knights as professe the order of Chiualrie errant: now I say, you shall discerne by the freeing of that good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who is there carryed captiue away, whether Knights ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous are to be held in price; and saying so, he strucke <hi>Rozinante</hi> with his heeles (for spurs he had none) and making him to gallop (for it is not read in any part of this true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, that <hi>Rozinante</hi> did euer passe one formall or full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer) he posted to encounter the disciplinants, although the Curate, Canon, and Barber did what they might to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, but all was not possible; and much lesse could he be detained by these outcries of <hi>Sancho,</hi> saying, whether do you goe Sir <hi>Don-Quixote?</hi> what Diuels doe you beare in your brest that incite you to runne thus against the Catholike faith? see Sir, vnfortunate that I am, how that is a Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of disciplinants, and that the Lady whom they beare, is the blessed Image of the immaculate Virgin, looke Sir what you doe, for at this time it may well be said, that you are not you know what. But <hi>Sancho</hi> laboured in vaine, for his Lord rode with so greedie a desire to encounter the white men, and deliuer the morning Ladie, as he heard not a word, and although he had, yet would he not then haue returned backe at the Kings commandement. Being come at last, neere to the Procession, and stopping <hi>Rozinante</hi> (who had already a great desire to rest himselfe a while) he said with a troubled and hoarse voice: O you that couer your faces, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are not good men, giue eare and listen to what I shall say: the first that stood at this alarme were those which carryed the Image; and one of the foure Priests which sung the Litanies, beholding the strange shape of <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:173111:299"/> the leanesse of <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and other circumstances worthy of laughter, which he noted in our Knight, returned him quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this answere. Good Sir, if you would say any thing to vs, say it instantly; for these honest men, as you see, are toiled extremely; and therefore wee cannot, nor is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reason wee should stand lingring to heare any thing, if it be not so brief, as it may be deliuered in two words; I will say it in one, said <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and it is this, that you doe forthwith giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to that beautifull Lady, whose teares &amp; pittifull sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance cleerely denote, that you carry her away against her will, and haue done her some notable iniurie; and I, who was borne to right such wrongs, will not permit her to passe one step forward, vntill shee be wholly possessed of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shee doth so much desire and deserue. All those that ouerheard <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> gathered by his words that he was some distracted man; and therefore beganne to laugh very hartily, which laughing seemed to adde gun-powder to his choler; for laying his hand on his sword without any more words, he presently assaulted the Image-carriers; one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of leauing the charge of the burden to his fellowes, came out to encounter the Knight with a wooden forke (whereon he supported the beere whensoeuer they made a stand) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing vpon it a great blow which <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at him, it parted the forke in two; and yet hee with the peece that remained in his hand returned the Knight such a thwacke vpon the shoulder, on the sword side, as his target not being able to make resistance against that rusticall force, to poore <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was ouerthrowen to the ground, and extremely bruised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancho Panca</hi> (who had followed him, puffing and blowing as fast as he could) seeing him ouerthrowne cryed to his aduersary that hee should strike him no more: for hee was a poore inchaunted Knight, that had neuer all the daies of his life done any man harme: but that which detained the swaine was not <hi>Sanchos</hi> outcries, but to see that <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> stirred neither hand nor foote, and therefore beleeuing
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:173111:300"/> that he had slaine him, hee tucked vp his coate to his gyrdle as soone as he could, and fled away through the fields like a Deere. In the meane while <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> companions did hasten to the place where hee lay, when those of the Procession seeing them (but principally the troupers of the holy Brotherhood with their Crosse-bowes) runne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, did feare some disastrous successe; and there fore they gathered together in a troupe about the Image, and lifting vp their hoods, and laying fast hold on their whips, and the Priestes on their Tapers, they attended the assault, with resolution both to defend themselues, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the assaylants if they might: but fortune disposed the matter better then they expected; for <hi>Sancho</hi> did nothing else then throw himselfe on his Lords body, making ouer him the most dolorous and ridiculous lamentation of the world, and beleeuing that hee was dead. The Curate was knowen by the other Curate that came in the procession; and their acquaintance appeased the conceiued feare of the two squadrons. The first Curate in two words, the other with what <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was, and therefore he, and all the crew of the disciplinants went ouer to see, whether the poore Knight were dead or aliue; and then might heare <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> with the teares in his eyes, bewayling him in this maner. O flower of Chiualrie, who hast with one blow alone ended the Carreere of thy so well bestowed Peeres? O renowme of this linage, thy honour and glorie of all the <hi>Mancha,</hi> yea and of all the world beside; which seeing it wanteth thee, shall remaine full of miscreants, secure from being not punished for their misdeedes. O liberall beyond all <hi>Alexanders,</hi> seeing thou hast giuen mee, for onely for eight moneths seruice, the best Iland that the Sea doeth compasse or ingirt. O humble to the proude, and stately to the humbled, vndertaker of perils, indurer of affronts, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured without cause, imitator of good men, whip of the euill, enemie of the wicked, and in conclusion, Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, then which no greater thing may be said.</p>
               <pb n="591" facs="tcp:173111:300"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> was called againe to himselfe by <hi>Sancho</hi> his out-cries, and then the first word that euer he spake was; he that liues absented from thee most sweete <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to greater miseries then this: helpe me friend <hi>Sancho</hi> to get vp into the inchanted Chariot againe, for I am not in plight to oppresse <hi>Rozinantes</hi> Saddle, hauing this shoulder broken all into peeces, that will I doe with a very good wil, my deere Lord, replied the Squire; and let vs returne to my village, in companie of those Gentlemen, which desire your welfare so much; &amp; there we will take order for some other voyage, which may bee more profitable, and famous then this hath beene, thou speakest reasonably <hi>Sancho</hi> replied <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> and it will bee a great wisedome to let ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the crosse aspect of those Planets that raigne at this present. The Canon, Curate, and Barbour commended his resolution, and so hauing taken delight enough in <hi>Sancho Pancas</hi> simplicitie, they placed <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> as before in the Teame. The processioners returning into their former order did prosecute their way; the goateheard tooke leaue of them all. The troupers would not ride any farther, and therefore the Curate satisfied them for the paines they had taken: The Canon intreated the Curate to let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all that succeeded of <hi>Don-Quixote;</hi> to wit whether he amended of his frensie, or grew more distracted, and then he tooke leaue, to continue his iourney. Lastly, all of them departed, the Curate, Barber, <hi>Don-Quixote, Sancho Panca,</hi> and the good <hi>Rozinante</hi> onely remaining behind. Then the waineman yoked his Oxen, and accommodated the Knight on a bottle of Hay; and afterward followed on in his wonted low maner, that way which the Curate directed. At the end of two dayes they arriued to <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, into which they entred about noone; this befell on a Sunday, when all the people were in the Market stead, through the middle whereof <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Cart did passe: all of them drew neere to see what came in it, and when they knew their Countrie man, they were marueilously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished:
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:173111:301"/> the whilst a little boy ranne home before, to tell the old wife and the Knights nice, that their Lord and vncle was returned, very leane, pale, disfigured, and stretcht all along on a bundell of hay.</p>
               <p>It would haue moued one to compassion to haue heard the lamentations, and out-cries, then raisd by the two good women; the blowes they gaue themselues, and the curses and execrations which they powred out against all Bookes of Knighthood, all which was againe renewed, when they saw <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> himselfe entred in at their doores. At the newes of this his arriuall, <hi>Sancho Pancas</hi> wife repaired also to get some tidings of her goodman; for shee had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he was gone away with the Knight, to serue him as his Squire, and as soone as euer shee saw her husband, the question shee asked him was, whether the Asse were in health or no. <hi>Sancho</hi> answered that hee was come in better health then his Master: God be thanked quoth shee, who hath done me so great a fauour, but tell me now friend, what profit hast thou reaped by this thy Squireship? What Peticote hast thou brought me home? What shooes for thy little boyes? I bring none of these things good wife, quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> although I bring other things of more moment, estimation: I am very glad of that, quoth his wife; shew me those things of more moment &amp; estimation good friend, for I would faine see them, to the end that this heart of mine may be cheered, which hath beene so swollen and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all the time of thine absence? Thou shalt see them at home quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi> and therfore rest satisfied for this time; for and it please God, that we trauaile once againe to seeke aduentures, thou shalt see me shortly after an Earle, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of an Iland, and that, not euery ordinarie one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of one of the best in the world. I pray God hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it may be so, (replied shee) for wee haue very great neede of it. But what meanes that Iland, for I vnderstand not the word. Honny is not made for the Asses mouth, quoth <hi>Sancho:</hi> wife thou shalt know it in good time, yea, &amp;
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:173111:301"/> shalt wonder, to heare the title of Ladiship giuen thee by all thy vassalles, what is that thou speakest, <hi>Sancho,</hi> of Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, Ilands, and vassalles? Answered <hi>Ioan Panca</hi> (for so was shee called, although her husband and shee were not kinsfolke; but by reason that in the <hi>Mancha</hi> the wiues are vsually called after their husbands surname) doe not busie thy selfe <hi>Ioan,</hi> quoth <hi>Sancho</hi> to know those things on such a suddaine; let it suffice that I tell thee the truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall sow vp thy mouth. I will onely say thus much vnto thee, as it were by the way, that there is nothing in the world so pleasant as for an honest man to be the Squire of a Knight Errant, that seeke aduentures, it is very true, that the greatest number of aduenturers found out, succeeded not to a mans satisfactions so much as he would desire: for of a hundred that are incountred, the ninetie and nine are wont to be crosse and vntoward ones; I know it by experience, for I haue come away my selfe out of some of thē well canuas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and out of others well beaten. But yet for all that it is a fine thing to expect euents, trauerse groues, search woods, treade on rockes, visite Castles, and lodge in Innes at a mans pleasure, without paying the diuell a crosse.</p>
               <p>All these discourses passed betweene <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> and his wife <hi>Ioan Panca,</hi> whilst the old woman, and <hi>Don-Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otes</hi> Niece did receiue him, put off his clothes, and lay him downe in his ancient bed: hee looked vpon them very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and could not coniecture where he was. The Curate charged the Niece to cherish her Vncle very carefully, and that they should look wel that he made not the third escape; relating at large all the adoe that they had had to bring him home. Here both the women renewed their exclamations: their execrations of all bookes of Knighthood here came to be reiterated: here they besought heauen to throw downe into the very Center of the bottomlesse pit, the outcries of so many lies and rauings. Finally, they remained perplexed and timerous, that they should loose againe their Master and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as soone as he was any thing recouered; and it befell iust
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:173111:302"/> as they suspected: but the Authour of this historie, although he haue with all diligence and curiositie inquired after the Acts atchieued by <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> in his third sallie to seeke aduentures, yet could he neuer attaine (at least by authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writings) to any notice of them: Only fame hath left in the memories of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> that <hi>Don-Quixote,</hi> after his third escape, was at <hi>Garagoca;</hi> and present at certaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous iusts made in that Cittie; and that therein befell him euents most worthy of his valour and good wit. But of his end hee could finde nothing, nor euer should haue knowne ought, if good fortune had not offered to his view an old Phisition, who had in his custodie a leaden box, which as he affirmed, was found in the ruines of an old Eremitage, as it was a repairing; in which box were certaine scrolles of Parchement written in with <hi>Gothicall</hi> Characters, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Castilian</hi> Verses, which comprehended many of his Acts, and specified <hi>Dulcinea of Toboso</hi> her beautie, decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Rozinante,</hi> and intreated of <hi>Sancho Pancas</hi> fidelity; as also of <hi>Don-Quixotes</hi> Sepulchre, with sundry Epitaphes, and Elogies, of his life and manners, and those that could bee read and copied out throughly, were those that are here set downe by the faithfull Authour of this new and vnmatched relation. Which Authour demaunds of the Readers no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guerdon, in regard of his huge trauaile spent in the search of all the old records of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> for the bring<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing thereof vnto light, but that they will deigne to afford it as much credit as discreet men are wont to giue vnto bookes of Knighthood, which are of so great reputation now a daies in the world; for herewith he will rest most fully contented, and satisfied; and withall incouraged to publish and seeke out for other discourses, if not altogether so true as this, at least of as great, both inuention, and recreation. The first words written in the Scrowle of Parchement, that was found in the leaden box, were these.</p>
